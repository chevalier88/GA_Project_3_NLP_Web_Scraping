[META] State of the Subreddit - 2020,Meta Post of the Year,"There have been quite a few changes in the subreddit over the past couple of years, both behind the scenes and more visibly.  As such, the mod team thought it would be a good time to discuss our vision for the subreddit and get feedback on these changes and our moderation more generally.

**Our Vision**

To some extent, our vision for the subreddit is perhaps easier to define by what we aren't trying to be, rather than what we want to be:

* We aren't trying to be a place for academic/technical discussions, since subreddits like r/MachineLearning, r/AskStatistics, and r/Python already cover those areas more specifically
* We aren't trying to be a place for learning about, transitioning into, or getting a job in data science, since there are countless other blogs and websites discussing how to do that
* We aren't trying to be a place for people or companies to promote themselves, either for commercial gain or simply to help them find a job

In a perfect world, r/datascience would simply be a social network for data science professionals to talk about anything related to work or not.  They could discuss something technical if it really interested them, but they would be just as likely to discuss sleeping habits or joke about leadership using buzzwords.

In essence, we are trying to be a ""**water cooler for people in the DS industry**""; having the kinds of conversations you might when you bump into someone while grabbing a coffee, or hanging out in the hallways of a conference between speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Moderation**

Unfortunately, the above vision has been hard to realize due to a number of factors.  We wanted to take some time to explain some of the reasoning behind our moderation decisions, in order to get feedback.  Here are some of the main reasons we remove posts:

1. **Blog/Project Links** \- People post links to a blog or project (often their own) with little to no discussion.  These are usually attempts at self-promotion, and at this point we will remove almost all of these regardless of the quality of content out of necessity.  In fact, certain commonly-used domains are entirely restricted.  
2. **Learners/Transitioners** \- People who want to become part of the industry, but are not currently.  In theory there is no problem with beginners involved in our conversations, but unfortunately the vast majority of these posts are very transactional in nature.  The subreddit is treated as a Career Development Center or Technical Advisor, rather than the ""water cooler"" mentioned before.  We originally planned to remove these posts completely, but a compromise was made to redirect them to the **Weekly Entering &amp; Transitioning Thread**. 
3. **Video Links, Surveys, and Listicles** \- These would be fine in theory, but in practice they have mostly tended to combine the negatives of blog links with the negative of being transactional.  It is easier just to remove them all on sight, though perhaps some could be added back with more moderator capacity.
4. **Memes** \- Dealing with memes was a difficult choice, since they often prompt great conversations and certainly are something one would expect for a ""water cooler"" environment.   
 On the other hand, they are usually pretty tacky and will overrun a large-ish subreddit if allowed.  Thus, we remove memes on any day but monday.
5. **Technical Questions** \- This category is difficult, and decisions may differ depending on the moderator.  Some questions clearly belong in one of the more technical subreddits, and are directed there.  Beyond that, we assess whether it feels like a ""Stack Overflow"" question, a homework question, or a ""Google Search"" question, and then direct people to those places if needed.
6. **Junk/Low Effort** \- Name speaks for itself.  This is actually somewhat uncommon for our subreddit, though that may be due to reddit's automatic moderation at work.
7. **Politics/Off-topic** \- While eventually we wouldn't mind having off-topic conversations like you might have at a water cooler, currently we will tend to remove them for consistency sake.  Political discussions in particular are removed unless they are explicitly about data science, as we don't want the kind of trouble those conversations can lead to on reddit.

More generally than the above factors, we try to consider each post and ask ourselves if the subreddit is better or worse with that content on it.  As you might also notice, our mod team is often quite busy (more on that below), so sometimes we will leave removable posts up simply because they have a lot of activity by the time we see them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Future**

We are continuing to make changes to try to improve the subreddit:

* **Content -** In addition to our long-running weekly ""Entering &amp; Transitioning"" thread, we have tested ""Meme Mondays"" and ""DS Topic of the Week"" as additional content drivers.  Furthermore, some work has been done to advance the wiki.
* **Moderation Bot** \- Our new moderation bot, u/datascience-bot, has allowed us to automate some of our work, and will hopefully one day be trained (based on our manual removals) to actually take on a significant amount of the moderation.  
* **Removal Reasons** \- We want to improve our selection of removal reasons and associated text.  This will help provide the person with more context/resources around the removal, and will hopefully provide better labels for the moderation bot to learn from.
* **Flairs** \- We sorta had a process for giving flairs to long-time users, but it needs to be revisited.  The process around link flairs needs to be adjusted as well.  Our hope is to actually build this capability into the moderation bot, at some point.
* **Moderators** \- We recently lost a couple of long-time moderators, and frankly we probably never had as many moderators as we needed to accomplish our vision.  The subreddit has also grown significantly in size (10x in three years), and most of the existing mods have jobs and families that leave us with limited time for moderating the subreddit.  **Our plan is to begin recruiting new moderators as soon this State of the Subreddit discussion winds down.**

Presenting Your Value,Career,"For starters, I’m a summer intern doing some data work for a large company that isn’t centered around stereotypical “data” stuff (for privacy that’s about as much as I can share). This company also seemingly doesn’t have a data analytics team or person, to the extent that I was brought on and have essentially free will on how I’m operating in my position. Again, sorry for the lack of information, but for context, the person who I’m working under was trying to do a very scaled back version of the project I’ve taken in Excel (in a very very basic spreadsheet). Naturally, I threw it into R to analyze the data, and they looked at me like I was some sort of computer God. Anyways, hopefully you can gather some context of the situation I’m in and the void in the company there undoubtedly is.

My question is, for those of you that have been in my situation, how exactly do you present the “hey, I can do this for you full-time, and this is how incredibly valuable having someone like this would be”? Again, it’s not a mom-and-pop startup, so even in this climate they undoubtedly have the capital for the position someway somehow. I get this is maybe more of a general “young adult looking to fill a void” question, but based on the lack of work done in the data, and considering its likely that the majority
of us have at least seen some sort of iteration of this scenario, I figured this would be the best place to ask.

FWIW, I have my bachelors and am working on my masters. Also, this isn’t an issue that is commonly faced by those of us working in data of “I don’t know how to best communicate these results with someone who isn’t fluent or comfortable in data vernacular”, it’s just that I don’t know how to present my value in a way that’s not overstepping my bounds or under-presenting(?) my value as a data scientist.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hdsxcj/presenting_your_value/,4,datascience,starter summer intern data work large company centered around stereotypical data stuff privacy much share company also seemingly data analytics team person extent brought essentially free operating position sorry lack information context person working trying scaled back version project taken excel basic spreadsheet naturally threw r analyze data looked like sort computer god anyways hopefully gather context situation void company undoubtedly question situation exactly present hey full time incredibly valuable someone like would mom pop startup even climate undoubtedly capital position someway somehow get maybe general young adult looking fill void question based lack work done data considering likely majority u least seen sort iteration scenario figured would best place ask fwiw bachelor working master also issue commonly faced u working data know best communicate result someone fluent comfortable data vernacular know present value way overstepping bound presenting value data scientist,presenting value

Real Estate Market Selection,Projects,"Hi all,

I'm very new to the data science community but I'm looking for some advice on a side project I'm working on. The real estate market seems very much to be an information game and I believe it results in significant market inefficiencies. With equities prices as high as they are at the moment, I'm dabbling in the world of real estate investing in anticipation for a correction in housing prices over the coming year. 

I want to take a very analytical approach to property analysis and acquisition. The first step seems to be a market selection analysis. This analysis should determine which markets are most profitable to enter as an investor. I've identified the following as key metrics:

\- Population Growth

\- Job Growth

\- Median Rental Rates (and YoY Growth)

\- Median Housing Prices (and YoY Growth)

\- # of Sales

\- Active Listings

&amp;#x200B;

I have been able to obtain datasets for most metropolitan areas in the U.S. but I am not sure about the best way to employ these sets to select a market. Given that I have a number of potential factors to consider when trying to determine the best areas, I figure I can either do a screening process similar to how one might in security analysis where you filter the data based on a set of criteria (current and future population and job growth above national avg., job creation above national avg., etc.) and I would be left with a list of qualifiers but narrowing it down would be somewhat subjective. 

The other option I think I could take is determining which factors are most important to housing prices or rent to value ratio (median home price / median rent) by running a regression or some model. Decision criteria could then be weighted on those factors and I could even create a composite score by distributing these weights to different factors and rank the locations based on composite. Is there an approach that I am missing or one that is best practice when it comes to this sort of thing?

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a while since I've done much statistical modelling and I'm currently learning python so I am hoping this will be a good starter project to develop some of those skills.

How to traverse the rabbit hole in Data Science,Discussion,"Data science often involves discovering or having to learn related mathematical /statistical concepts while working on a project. People refer to this as ""Going down the rabbit hole"". 

For example, while working on a recommender engine, I decided to implement NMF. I understood it conceptually but decided to study matrix factorization deeply (had forgotten some aspects after high school). That in-turn led me to read about rank, span et all more deeply. Long story short, i spent 1 week learning about matrix and matrix operations. I realized I spent more time than necessary.

My question is

* How does one know how deep a rabbit hole one must go? 
* How to intelligently criss-cross between parallel rabbit holes gaining enough *'what you were looking for'* rather than going too deep",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hdt3wm/how_to_traverse_the_rabbit_hole_in_data_science/,3,datascience,data science often involves discovering learn related mathematical statistical concept working project people refer going rabbit hole example working recommender engine decided implement nmf understood conceptually decided study matrix factorization deeply forgotten aspect high school turn led read rank span et deeply long story short spent week learning matrix matrix operation realized spent time necessary question one know deep rabbit hole one must go intelligently criss cross parallel rabbit hole gaining enough looking rather going deep,traverse rabbit hole data science

Hiring frustrations,Discussion,"A bit of a rant about hiring new talent right now, and a few questions for those that have been/are maybe going through the same right now due to Covid19.

We're looking to hire a new junior data scientist at a small consulting firm, so we  posted an ad on LinkedIn. We made sure that the applicants knew that they had to be a US citizen or green card holder and we would not sponsor H1b nor participate in OPT. This was done with filter questions, and all caps bolded text in the job description BOTH at the beginning and end of the job description. We received around 1500 resumes in about 72 hours.

We've been going through these resumes and doing a basic phone screen on the potential candidates, but so far all of them lied about their US immigration status on our filter questions. From 200 calls, all 200 lied about their status.

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to avoid this problem, so we're not wasting about a week chasing down potential candidates that we'll never hire?

We hired before about six months ago and only had about a hand full of these cases. I know times are tough due to COVID and these applicants want to stay in the USA, but we can't take them. It's  frustrating to say the least, and a huge waste of time.

Amazon AWS Pro-Serve Data Scientist is it a good role?,Career,"Hello all,

I am a Data Scientist at a Fortune 500 company, with a PhD in Electrical Engineering. For the last 5 years, I thought myself Python and Data Science and progressed a lot in that arena. I wanted some change after 5 years in the same company and wanted to explore options. Amazon AWS Pro Serve sounded interesting as you get to work with different companies. I did not want to work on a deep Machine Learning Problem on my cubicle (after corona, for now home desk :) ). I was excited about meeting new people and potentially solving data problems for different industries.

Am I making a right choice? Is Pro-serve considered to be same with, say ""Applied scientist"" role in AWS (asking in regards to: 1) career growth, 2) reputation and 3) financial) ? Is meeting new people and potentially gaining more exposure to different industries in Pro-serve a naive way of thinking? As we all know customer's behaviors can vary.

All in all I thought, exposing myself to different people and industries, in the future can help me even become an independent consultant, yes? Whereas If I am an applied scientist, I need to be deeply involved in ""creating the AWS tools from scratch"" vs using them in the AWS Pro-serve role.

If you have any experience with AWS Pro-serve data scientist roles, please chime in. Thanks in advance.

Edit: Also I want to mention the bad work/life balance rumors AWS has. I, for some reason, assumed AWS pro-serve may be different, and hopefully more balanced. But I do not have enough evidence to say neither for sure.

"Ask DataScience: What tools do you use to write, test, and build SQL queries?",Tooling,"I've vaguely heard this type of tool called a SQL runner. The common tasks this kind of tool solves:

* A scratch workspace to write multi-line sql queries and test them out
*  Ability to get metadata for tables/ queries, such as number of rows, indexes, timing information, constraints
*  Be able to inspect the columns, their types, and some row values
* Being able to print the ERD diagram of a database
* Exporting a SQL result set as a CSV or other types
* Autocomplete a SQL query with valid options for clauses
* Useful error tracing for syntax issues

I've used and tried out a variety of tools over the years, and for one reason or another end up switching between them. Some of the tools I've used:

* plain PSQL: honestly a very fast tool, and some of the options work well in a terminal. Terrible for multi-line query editing
*  [PgCLI](https://www.pgcli.com/docs): superior to plain psql as it provides auto-completion + multi-line editing similar to an iPython terminal
* (paid) [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/): slower and bulkier than pgCLI, but provides scratch workspace + exporting to CSV as options
* [Sequel Pro](http://sequelpro.com/): I used this a lot for MYSQL databases, it was so much better than the Mysql Workbench
* [Mysql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/): I only used this to print out the ERD diagrams, it was too slow to be useful
* [PopSQL](https://popsql.com/): a gorgeous editor, but honestly the whole program would freeze (and need to be killed by a process manager)  when we loaded in too many rows in a single query. Kind of a deal breaker lol.

Current Data Scientist Considering a Return to Academia,Education,"Since completing my undergrad in mathematics four years ago, I have worked at a tech company in the Bay Area (non FAANG) as a data scientist, and my total compensation is now at about 190K.

Storing ad hoc data wrangling requests in GitHub?,Discussion,"Hi All!

At my job, I get a decent amount of ad hoc wrangling requests where I write some SQL queries to get a certain data set. For the most part these are one-off (larger ones or ones with more than data wrangling I will create a git repo).

For the one-off ones, I currently just throw all of them into a single repo (like my username_sql_queries) but we also use Agile and so each ad hoc request is basically just assigned as a story. 

Anyone have maybe a better way of organizing stuff like this? Creating a branch for different requests and then merging into the main branch after it's accepted? A different tool for organization?

Forever a fraud ? Keep having horrific interviews and feel like I can never become a Data Scientist,Job Search,"I have had some experience working as a machine learning engineer but if I am honest with myself, I barely did much. I am 24 with 2 years of experience. Got laid off, rightfully so.

Position focuses mainly on “explaining drivers”,Career,"Hey everyone,

I work as a DS for a fortune 100 company. It’s my first data science role and I’ve been here a little short of a year. We have no way of implementing models and I’ve built a few production worthy scoring engines. The company is trying to get up to speed with analytics and data science but is still behind in the curve in terms of technology and utilizing data and their data scientists.

This leads to my question. Is anyone else in a role where you are “looking for drivers” or “key factors” regularly. It seems as though this is a huge majority of the work and all people care about. “Looking for segments” or “tell stories”. It seems extremely trivial and the amount of work reducing extremely wide datasets to a selection of variables that can tell a story is a relatively big task. They’re so open ended and can tend to be misleading. This feels like more of a business analytics role (even though so many titles seem arbitrary). They’re looking to have a production ready environment by the end of this year but it seems that actually having the business utilize scoring engines is unlikely. 

Doing these segmentations or “drivers” of events is what stakeholders care about. Is this very common in data science? Am I looking at this position wrong?

How to combine data science with data engineering?,Career,"Hey everyone.

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics"").

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well.

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira.

Now, I really have a tough decision to make. Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science? What would be the best path to take?

* I know with R, enough RAM to fit datasets into memory and work with them isimportant, but does additional RAM beyond that help? What about RAM speed? (e.g. would 2400MHz -&gt; 3200MHz make any difference?)

What laptop is the most optimal one to get that is just enough to get anything done within data science?,Discussion,"If you had to work out of the office, what is the best laptop to get at the lowest price where you can still get all data science stuff done? I expect that these tasks would involve opening and processing heavy excel files, coding, visualizing data, accommodating video calls properly, and anything else I forgot to mention.

If I am correct in my assumption I would say this laptop would have at least 16GB RAM and at least an i7 processor. But correct me if I am wrong.

Also of course, this laptop should be dependable and thus durable. Do you have any suggestions?

Another 'Am I a data scientist' question,Career,"So I'm deep in my career, which when I was hired was mostly focuses on analytics.  I.E.  Excel charting.  

As a programmer, I migrated away from excel and have a lot of automation using things like Jenkins for devops/data pipeline things and R Studio and Shiny apps to create apps for visualizing and working with data.  I do a lot of data engineering in oracle, creating repositories for internal apps and to serve to other enterprise apps outside of my department.  And lots of analysis via PLSQL queries against our database that runs our business.

I have practically no experience in Machine Learning or Neural Networks.

Most folks are classified as business analysts here.  Which is a range of people who use the gui of our business system and configure it via gui prompts, to devOps and our front and back end developers.

I tapped out of the front end game as data was my thing.  (Im way above average with my SQL and subject matter expertise of Oracle systems) And over the last year have really been learning R and Shiny apps to where we have a lot of real time dashboards and metrics to view (some on always on wall displays).

Identifying Patterns in Time Series Data With Multiple Variables,Projects,"I must warn before I begin that I am coming from the hard science sphere (and am trying to integrate some novel data science) so some of the things I talk about might make no sense. Please ask questions!

I have a database of \~20 variables that are collected continuously over time. This database is essentially measuring the conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field (too complex to model) which drives numerous phenomena that occur in the Earth's atmosphere, etc. These phenomena are of interest to researchers but only occur ever so often. To find these, you have to manually search years and years of data, something that is simply not too practical.

I want to develop some sort of method to take a number of instances of a phenomenon and search the continuous database for more instances. I think that this needs to be split into two tasks.

1. Discover common patterns (dips, spikes, sign changes, or even more complex ""shapes"") between the inputted instances. It will also have to discern the variables of interest because not all in the database will drive a single phenomenon. Moreover, if the program can then output these relationships (such as variables appear to drive the phenomenon) this will be of interest to users.
2. Use these relationships to search the continuous stream for more instances.

Like I mentioned, I am not very experienced in data science. Of course, I am not asking anyone here to develop this for me or anything, but it would be really helpful if someone could point me in the right direction. Eventually, I would like to develop some sort of robust methodology that can be applied to many scientific fields.

Monte Carlo (or other methods) for Ingredient Concentration Estimation,Projects,"Weird title but hear me out.

**THE PROBLEM**

I have a sample product that is comprised of let's say 3 ingredients, each with concentrations listed in ranges of the total product composition:

&amp;#x200B;

|Ingredient|min concentration (%)|max concentration (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|x|25|50|
|y|25|50|
|z|25|50|

Now based on the concentration of each ingredient, the overall product is going to have a different toxicity profile.

If x = 50% y = 25% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of say 100.

But if x = 25%, y = 50% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of perhaps 75.

This is a real world problem (ingredients are often listed in ranges), so I guess I can assume normality of the distribution of each ingredient range (or uniformity?).

**WHAT I WANT**

I want to show a probability distribution of overall toxicity, based on some simulated concentration values. Maybe making 1000 potential ingredient ""configurations"" and then running the resulting calculations.

Things I Learned while building Machine Learning web app,Projects,"These past weeks I've been working on an ML web app as a side project. Being a Data Scientist, I decided to take on this project for two reasons. First, it would make for a good learning experience for the things I'm not very comfortable with like Design/Front-end and Deployment tasks. Second, as I found most of the materials lacking, I thought I could gather some useful information to write a blog post about it.

I made a web app that tracks the sentiment on twitter towards the leaders of the top political parties in Spain. It works —more or less— in real-time. The site is live here: [https://polituits.com/](https://polituits.com/)

Some things went well, others that I could have done better, and others that at this point I'm not sure haha (e.g., How much traffic would it handle?). I thought I could share those things before getting to work on the blog post.

I'll start with the **things that made my life easier:**

1. [End-to-end Machine Learning App](https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/case-studies/end-to-end-ml-app). This is a great resource. It goes through the full process of building a Machine Learning application in a realistic setting. Most of the materials you'll find out there will skip deployment or work with simple data sets. This one goes from scraping to deploying in AWS. A few days ago, I also read [this one](http://veekaybee.github.io/2020/06/09/ml-in-prod/), which I also recommend.
2. [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). I compared Streamlit and Dash and went with the latter for better documentation and a more significant community. The deployment part was especially painful, so proper documentation was critical to get the job done.
3. [HugginFace's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/). If you are working with NLP tasks in languages other than English, check HuggingFace's repository of community models. Furthermore, it is relatively easy to integrate into an inference service built with Pytorch/Flask.
4. [Abhishek Thakur's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPRJjIWfyNG4X-CRbnv78A) and [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/notebooks) for fine-tuning BERT. Fantastic resources that saved me a lot of time. Especially when using those ideas with a pre-trained BERT in Spanish from HuggingFace's transformers.
5. More generally, I benefited from keeping the toolset simple. I used PowerPoint when I started designing the app (see the initial design [here](https://twitter.com/_dylancastillo/status/1272238506916675591)), SQLite as a database, and Python/Dash (instead of JavaScript).

Now, the **things that I wish I had done differently:**

1. Contain the scope. I started with a straightforward idea and then started adding stuff that just made my life harder. Most of the time, I think it was because I felt the app was not ""complex"" enough for publishing it.
2. Deployment. Ha! The only good thing about it's that it ""works"". Right now, it is a painfully manual process. I should have gotten to a better deployment process from the beginning. By the time I started deploying, it felt like too much work.
3. Sacrificed code quality. I wanted to ship this quickly. So the code is not DRY. It's more like CRY yourself to sleep. Refactoring is among my top priorities now.
4. Model. It's not great right now. It only gets the job done. I did not dedicate that much time to labeling data for fine-tuning the model. This is also a priority for me right now.

Finally, there are many things for which I don't know if I was following the ""best practices."" In particular, setting up NGINX and Gunicorn felt a bit *hacky*. Sooner or later, I guess I'll find out.

Is statistics and the math behind data science and ML increasingly becoming less important?,Discussion,"I've been reading through recent career thread on this sub, namely [I'm offered a data engineer role instead of data science, should I take it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/h8yjdf/im_offered_a_data_engineer_role_instead_of_data/) and [From Data Scientist to Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/h9p4kl/from_data_scientist_to_machine_learning_engineer/), and it seems like there are a couple overarching themes: that nowadays, data science and ML jobs are largely about  building pipelines, deploying models and other engineering things related to building out an ML system; that the modeling is only a small part of the job.

Keep a Brag Document,Career,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

Do you sometimes wish you could do data science as a hobby rather than a job?,Career,"I'm working for an R&amp;D tech company, and my team is developing a niche NLP product. I have developed a serious interest in NLP, but I secretly wish I could use NLP for my personal projects (of which I have plenty of ideas), rather than my job. Some of my frustrations of the latter include:

- Having to read so many badly-written papers and repos. Furthermore, I find the leaderboard chasing and the Frankenstein deep learning models quite off-putting (do we really need transformer + CNN + multi-task learning + multi-lingual model + dual-encoder evaluated on 10 different datasets without any deeper analysis within a single paper?).
- Many of the deep learning models might work well in some leaderboard, but incorporating them to our data is rife with logistical and performance issues. Worse is that most of them are just black-box models with little means to debug if they return a wrong result.
- I'm not really interested in the product that we're building so much that I'm willing to go all in with regard to the above two points. I keep day-dreaming about the NLP projects that *I* want to build and the interesting NLP papers that *I* want to read. Worse is that I'm often so burned out at work that I find little motivation to do any further work on NLP after work.

Perhaps my grievances are with the R&amp;D nature of my job, rather than data science itself. I recently interviewed for a product-focused data scientist role at another company, and my secret wish is that I could do the more ""routine"" data science at work (think regression, clustering, etc.) and do the more cutting-edge data science as a hobby.

Analysts Committing Data Science Fraud,Discussion,"Has anyone had this discussion before? Is there a field threshold for what would be considered fraud? Sure, some people make mistakes and the empirical method always allows for correction, but what about people working in the field who are literal hucksters? Does anyone have examples besides mine below?

I’m talking about the likes of Siraj Raval, or worse, the nobodies at small to medium firms who fakes their way into roles and have no qualifications or backgrounds.

Example, an analyst where I work said this to me and firmly believes it, “statistics is just for making the data look good, the way you want.” When I heard that my jaw dropped. Here is a person working as a data analyst who believes all statistics is meant for it manipulating data to make it look “good.” I’ve also witnessed this analyst, in a presentation to management, display a bar chart with manipulated bins to make them rise along side another series, and then claim correlation! Also, they’ve used that word when comparing two separate pie charts! Manipulating bins to hold different ranges in this manner is surely fraud. Leaning on “correlation” for every chart you produce is just negligent.

Data Preprocessing Technologies Question,Tooling,"Hey folks,

I'm working on a small dataset of audio wav files (about 8000 new audio files a day). There's a set of preprocessing and augmentation tasks that we perform on top of each of these audio files which in total take about 10s per audio file (we're using librosa for our audio processing tasks).   


Would like to make this applicable as a general discussion but with the following added notes

\- Assume that obtaining additional compute resources (on-premise or on the cloud) is not a problem 

\- Preprocessing must happen when all new files are collected and not as they are obtained

What would be a reasonable set of technologies to use for a Data Pipeline in this scenario with the goal of reducing the total preprocessing time to under an hour (currently sitting at around 22 hours)?

In logic, high value customers should get better service, but in practice we don't differentiate customers because they all receive the best service we could (or try to) offer.

[as a mentee] How to get the most out of a mentoring conversation,Career,"Hi all! I am a new data scientist (&lt; 1 YOE) who recently started a new role where I am the only data scientist on a team of devs/PMs … yes, I realized quickly the challenges working in isolation. Fortunately, I am at a company with many data scientists on other teams, so the isolation is not 100%.

I’ve already had helpful conversations where these data scientists \[outside my team\] share answers to questions like “what does your role look like”, “what’s something you knew when you first started” and other such broad topics. But these are one-time questions, and I am wondering how to maintain the relationship. **Specifically, are there more incisive topics that make sense to discuss over weeks/months? By make sense, I mean 1) enjoyable &amp; organic for an experienced data scientist to share and 2) beneficial to a newbie data scientist?**

Put another way, the conversations I’ve had in this role are either 1) super technical (“maybe change the X hyperparameter”) or 2) super high level “I wish I had known X when I started”. I wonder if there are topics that are at an in-between level of technicality that feel natural for both mentor &amp; mentee to talk about.

***I was thinking*** I could ask them to talk a bit about their current project, e.g. what kinds of data they rely on / what techniques have been most useful, surprises and pain points, etc. But I don't know if that is too much of an imposition, particularly since I'm not a team member and don't necessarily have full context of the problems they are solving (nor can I help them in return).

how much face-to-face interaction vs. coding do you get at work?,Discussion,"Hi. COVID-19 aside, how much of your job is spent talking to colleagues compared to coding by yourself (or doing something else)?

Autoregressive model with an exogenous variable?,Discussion,"Before I start, I should say I’m an engineer rather than a data scientist, so please excuse any ignorance on my part.

I’ve got a univariate time series - a bunch of physical measurements which describe the performance of a machine I’m working with. This data has a cyclical pattern. What I’ve seen is that the measurements are generally high during the middle of the day and low at night. Given my understanding of the equipment, I believe that the data is influenced by both the ambient temperature (it’s outside) and by its internal state or past performance. I’ve looked at PACF and ACF which supports the latter.

What I want to do is build a model which will estimate its performance at t0 given measurements at t-1 ... t-n and the ambient temperate at t0. That way, if the estimated performance is way out of whack from its actual measured performance, I know something unusual is happening and I can schedule a maintenance inspection.

A plain old AR model might be sufficient, but that doesn’t take into account temperature. I’m thinking about training an LSTM model, but that seems like overkill. Are there any other models I ought to consider?

It feels too early in my career to feel burnt out, but I cannot overstate how bored I am. So much of the work is ""investigate why this metric moved in this direction"". It's not only incredibly boring, it's unrewarding: after hours or days of slicing the same data a dozen different ways, we rarely unearth an explanation, anyway. 

I'm tired of ad hoc analyses, but I don't want to go back to school for a master's to learn and/or be considered for ML jobs, either. It doesn't interest me.

I hear people talk about loving data visualization, or enjoying investigating and telling a story with data, and while I believe them, it's also kinda incomprehensible to me at this point.

How or What do you model for in an inherently unpredictable field?,Discussion,"Hello my fellow data science professionals, I hope you all are keeping safe and doing well.

So a bit of background to the question, one of my close friend runs a business which operates in the event &amp; entertainment industry.
He is a vendor that provides a niche service for large format events &amp; activations. let's call this service A for the sake of this post.

Service A requires a lot of equipment and people who are skilled in operating that equipment. He has his own large inventory of equipment but once in a while, he gets an event with a large scope, wherein to be able to provide that service, he has to purchase more inventory, which might be used immediately or can remain with him for a long time.
He has employees hired to manage and deliver the service, but again if the scope of an event is large, he hires freelance manpower to execute and provide the said service.  

As a nature of the industry itself, everything is need-based. the way it usually works is:
A client (can be corporate or a wealthy private client) sends out a brief of what he/they intend to celebrate or organize an event -&gt; This brief usually goes out to few event management companies -&gt; these companies propose a plan/theme/budget -&gt; client approves it/negotiates on a budget -&gt; event happens.

Now, the event management companies can approach my friend for service A, either during the proposal phase or after the proposal is approved in which case they have already factored in a service A in their proposal and budgeted a certain amount for it.
Each approach by the event company is considered as an incoming inquiry for hiring his services.

My friend approached me if I can help him out in some way using data science. I have been thinking about but cannot figure out a an idea to model for. Whatever I do I want to ensure that it helps his bottom line. As you can imagine, the current pandemic has destroyed the industry and his business altogether, and since he has some time, he asked me for my help in gathering some insights which will enable him to tweak his processes for the future.

I thought of modeling for his handling of inquiries, wherein I can glean some insight into the probability of an inquiry turning into a business which helps him focus his resources on something which has more probability of generating revenue, but again he and his business are blind to what is going on at the event manager side, he only sees what comes to him and he keeps track of it.

There are other aspects of his business where I believe something can be done, for example, Inventory management &amp; analysis, optimizing operational manpower (he uses inhouse and freelance manpower for his business), but these do not directly help in bottom line, they will help indirectly in a long term and I'm not discounting it, it's just not a priority for him.

So basically what I'm asking is, has anyone modeled for a business that is inherently unpredictable like stock markets and what would you even start looking at which will translate into the bottom line for the company.

"How do you measure experience, pain points customers have in interactions with customer care?",Discussion,"I am working on a pet project, where I am trying to find scope of improvement in services of a telecom company and also the customer care interactions. For a start, I have picked all interactions on relation to changing rate plan. Customers can use any channel to change their plan - web, app, call care support, chat with an agent, visit store etc. I am looking for a way to measure pain in their journey while changing plans - how much time did it take to browse plans and make a choice, was the app experience so bad that the customer had to call care center, were there any wrong expectations set or miscommunication that made the customer call back care after the change (issues with billing, device etc)

One way I thought made sense would be to use CSAT score, find correlation with features like time spent, number of calls or visits, number of times channels was switched, and try to come up with a way to quantify the pain experienced in each step.

The Future: Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production,Discussion,"Hello everyone,

I've seen variations of the question ""What is the future of data science?"" asked before, but I think mine is unique enough that it would make for a good discussion in its own post. It's based on a 2020 RStudio Conference presentation mentioned in some other posts, called ""[Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/value-in-data-science-beyond-models-in-production/)"".

In the presentation, the speaker makes the case for why Data Scientists should focus their efforts on providing value through things ***other than*** deploying machine learning to production. As an aside, I think the definition of ""Data Scientist"" he is using is more of a Decision Scientist. The gist of his message is:

* Machine Learning Engineers are likely going to take the ML work that Data Scientists currently do, and will create off-the-shelf ML tools (e.g. AutoML), hence decreasing the need for Data Scientists to do ML.
* Data Engineers are already better than Data Scientists at cleaning data, building pipelines, and warehousing, and so this part of the data science process will be owned by Data Engineers.
* What work does that leave for Data Scientists? What the speaker describes sounds like the work of a Product Analyst:
   * Business Intelligence-type work (metric design, measurement, goal-setting, creating self-service data tools)
   * A small amount of ad-hoc ML modeling
   * Inform business strategy / product design based on data analysis
   * Experimentation
   * The human side of data work - ethics and communication

Here are some questions that the presentation raised for me:

Walk me through your DS Stack - ML DevOps,Tooling,"Dear Data Magicians

'tis the time. Show me your DS Stack! Our field is going through rapid transitions, many of these focused on operationalization (yes it is a word). In a sense, how do we jump from the '*guy in the basement who comes up with cool models*' to '*well oiled machinery that spits out and maintains awesome models*'. 

Let's standardise the responses somewhat, then I'll collect the responses as much as I can at the end of this main post. 

I'd like people to simply list the technology they use at their firm. Some of us may use experiment tracking, others do not. Some may require high-frequent updates, others do not, and so forth.

Please add a link to the technology you refer to :-)

**Tech. challenges I've yet to find a solution for:**

* How to best manage models that read/write from DBs best way possible?
* Efficient ways to automatically run tests on X independent separate ML models
* Best way to store and access (large) flat files

**Curious to try or work with**

* Kubeflow
* MLflow
* GCP vs AWS vs Azure vs Bluemix - Pros/Cons?

**Best advice**

* If you don't have one already - Design a standardised best practices handbook for your team. You should have a template for a DL project, as well as smaller ML projects. The template should be designed in a way that allows for easy reproducibility and productisation (See previous post I've written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gw8z13/do_you_code_in_object_oriented_way_in_python_when/fsu2p8p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))
* The rest of your organisation is not necessarily interested in what you are interested in. **Do not focus on mathematical rigor but business objectives.** 
* **Fail fast:** If you cannot get some value relating to the business objective out of the data, post cleaning of course, move on. Summarise findings and what you think is needed to achieve the sought after business objective (Additional data / Other data / Qualitative analysis - Shadow a worker in a function), hypothesise on the reasons for why the relation is not there.

Tips on Converting Colleagues to Scala from Pyspark?,Discussion,"I've been a huge proponent of Pyspark, but lately I've been working with very large datasets and have realized how much of a boon Scala really is.

Any other tips to help transition the org to Scala? I don't want to be one of four data scientists writing Scala because inevitably some manager will tell me to conform and write pyspark instead.

Apache airflow,Tooling,"Hi,

I'm considering using airflow for my ML pipeline on AWS, and I have some questions about basic setup (perhaps noobish). 

I would prefer a serverless setup, but that seems out of the question in the cloud, since you have to host an airflow server?

The airflow server seems like a bit of an overkill, and I'm unsure how to control costs, scaling, python environments and memory/cpu/gpu requirements to each pipeline step?

Alternatively I thought about using it as 'command station', where the ML pipeline just delegates pipeline tasks to fargate and lambda functions - this seems nice, because I can get all the flexibility that I want using those other services, while keeping the server small.  


The reason I want to use airflow is of course because it seems awesome, and I would like to have that overview over the pipes etc. I could just setup a bunch of lambdas/containers, but I would never know if anything had failed.

My thoughts on the data science job hunt during COVID-19,Job Search,"Some background: I have 6 years of DS experience, 2 masters degrees, and spent a few years as a data analyst as well. Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

Would it be foolish for me to turn down a (non-data) Tesla internship?,Job Search,"My undergrad and professional background is in industrial engineering/supply chain but I started grad school for data science last fall. I have always loved stats and programming which is what drew me to IE but felt like I wasn’t able to get roles that were analytical *enough* for my liking. 

This week I was able to secure two offers for summer internships (after weeks of anxious scrambling but that’s another story). One of them is Tesla. While obviously not a part of FAANG, I definitely perceive Tesla as at or just below that level. The only “issue” is that it’s not really an analytical role, it’s very supply chain oriented (like my background) with just one project with one of their analytics teams (which was a post-offer request from me). So like best-case scenario, the role is like 20-25% analytics, and the rest is similar to experience I already have. 

All I’ll say about the other offer is it’s a place that’s reputable but nowhere near the level of Tesla, and that the role’s primary function is about data management and analysis, more what I was hoping for. 

As someone who’s trying to break into the tech industry, is it foolish of me to turn down a summer at Tesla, even if the role is not very techy?

Professional Data Scientists: How do you track your experiments?,Tooling,"Hi everybody,  
I need some collective knowledge on collaborative data science. Mainly what I am looking for is to get a better overview over my teams experiments / training of models.  


Our current state:  
We are currently training NN for Computer Vision using jupyter notebooks, csv files for labels and operation systems directories to store the images. People execute their notebooks and they sometimes get errors because someone else is currently training on that gpu (of which we have 2).

  
So what am I looking for?  
1. A data store for our datasets with some kind of data lineage. (Can be solved by postgres or what ever. Fair enough.)  
2. Provisioning of some kind of execution queue so that people can queue up their notebooks and have the results 24h later.  
3. A multi tenant experiment store (like model db, ml flow -- but I would like it to have support for multiple users).  
4. The possibility to review and comment on experiments so that we can assist and teach each other. Similar to how gitlab handles pull / merge requests.  
5. OpenSource.  
6. Optional: self-hostable for free.   


Multi Tenancy is a must for me. We need open discussions on approaches to Data Science / ML Problems. So is open source -- mainly for the same reason.   


Technologies I looked into but am very happy about for comments:  
Kubeflow, OpenShit/OpenDataHub, Mlflow, VertaAi/modelDb

*Check the correlation between variables (heatmaps, VIF, etc.)

*Check the feature importance’s/model coefficients 

*Use SHAP values / charts to understand the directionality of model features 

*Plot the drop-off in accuracy when eliminating features (either through backward elimination or pruning the most important features)

I am working on a problem of binary classification. With a pretty small data set (100 observations, 21 features, and 70-30 target split)

How do you approach ML/ DS problem?,Discussion,"Hi folks! I am currently working as a Software Engineer in a Reporting/Analysis team using SAP BO and SQL. I am trying to get a job as a data scientist and had applied to a bunch of companies and did attend interview in a few. In the last interview which I gave, the interviewer asked me the above question, and I couldn't say anything which was able to convince him.

I have taken a bunch of MOOC courses and had worked on common UCI datasets. I have recently started with Kaggle as well (trying the basic one's right now). I know I have to improve a lot, but this question keeps on pondering me, as the interviewer was okay with me working with iris dataset as I am fresher with less than 1 year of full-time experience. He just wanted to know my answer to the above question. I tried thinking and giving a generalized answer but he wasn't impressed and asked how did you solve iris problem. Having watched n number of tutorials, the bias kicked in and I just said that I need to do EDA, understand the relationship between parameters and then go about solving the problem by applying, any of the many Classification algorithm, which I had done.

But he wasn't having it and this got me thinking that in the real-world you won't be given a dataset to work with, forget about proper expectation/requirement. And you cannot waste/invest a lot of time doing EDA as the client is looking for a working model and not a bunch of graphs and visualizations, so how to actually approach a ML/DS problem?

"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.",Discussion,"&amp;#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&amp;D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",663,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gv3i57/so_many_people_disappointed_with_their_jobs_you/,102,datascience,amp x b keep seeing thread forum disappointed many people data science job amp x b think expectation need managed line work seniority juniority start medical doctor start diagnosing dr house like rare life threatening condition straight away join law firm start passionately single handedly defending client court like john grisham book join goldman sachs graduate start managing multi billion trade investment straight away job certain amount grunt work greater beginning career world full bright kid disappointed first job wondering really study year change colour powerpoint slide importance within organisation varies wildly place place generally regardless guff hr say many organisation clear difference food chain function seen generating revenue seen support function many place sale team equivalent brings home money everyone else seen support function need argue shortsighted need understand attitude common need homework culture like joining company make decision accordingly related background senior people data scientist company senior executive kind technical background likely appreciated company senior guy almost always guy salesperson go sensory shutdown moment mention anything complicated time table real need business even enlightened organisation technical sensible competent open minded etc etc executive need boring work exciting cutting edge work every person must proper r amp brand new cutting edge model process technology etc need many people must manage maintain existing process model important even le interesting,many people disappointed job need manage expectation especially junior

Do less Data Science,Discussion,"That's why we're all here, right? 

I'd like to share with you a nice little story. I've recently been working on a difficult scoring problem that determined a rank from numerous features. There were numerous issues: which features were most important, did it make sense to have so many features, do we condense them, do we take the mean and so on. I had been working on this problem for weeks, and after numerous measurements, reports, reading and testing, I conked out -- I gave up. 

Man, Data Science was done for me; I was so over it. I started talking more with my colleagues in different departments, primarily in PR. I just felt like doing something else for a few days. I asked one of my colleagues in PR, ""so, what would you do if you had to rank X, Y, and Z?"" ""Hmm... I'm not so sure, I think I would be more interested in Z than X, why is X even necessary?"" She was right. Statistically, X was absolutely necessary in many of my modes. My boss thought this was the key to solving our problem, why would she think it's unnecessary? It turns out... as Data Scientists, we weren't the ones using the product. My colleague -- bless her soul -- is exactly our target audience. We were so in solutions mode, we forgot to just think about the problem and WHOM it concerns. 

I decided to take a walk and put pen to paper. I even asked the barista at the local cafe. It was so obvious. 

We were solving the WRONG problem the whole time -- well, at least we weren't making it any easier for ourselves.

To all of the great DS minds out there, sometimes we need to stop and reset.

At what point do you stop with a clustering problem?,Tooling,"Hey guys, 

So we’re looking to cluster our social demographic data. I’m pretty new to clustering validation and when to say, “this is good enough.” 

We have no pre labeled data to test our clusters,  only silhouette scores of ~ 0.65

At what point do I stop optimizing clustering problems, or is it subjective? 

For some background on the problem: 
We aim to label the data into 5~6 clusters (domain knowledge from my boss suggests in theory there should be 5~6 categories. Will discuss with him more), 

We wish to use the data to synthesize new data. I’m not too sure how we will achieve this, maybe a variational Autoencoder, or we simply find the closest centroid for data of our choice and sample from the centroid (this is the added restriction that our data is distributed in different ways as we are working with real estate data)

Given the problem, I’d say it’s important we have very clearly defined clusters, but

Real World Data Collection,Projects,"Hi, I am a recent college grad and I majored in data science so I have taken my fair share of courses and projects in machine learning and statistics. However, most, if not all of the projects I do in school and even the personal projects I work on the data is very readily available and in decent shape where I just need to do some cleaning and manipulation of the data.

Currently, I am working on a project where I am trying to process emails and build a type of importance algorithm based on the contents/data of the email.

The emails contain sensitive information and the preliminary dataset I have been testing on (very small size, &lt;100 emails) has any sensitive info redacted which is fine. But when I get to the point where I will need tens of thousands of emails it is extremely impractical to redact each one.

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas of ways to build a model that either doesn't use the contents of the emails, or a way to deal with the sensitive information problem.

I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,Discussion,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do &amp; where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard &amp; interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing &amp; analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization &amp; efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

How to avoid non-technical errors and bugs ?,Discussion,"Dear data-scientists,

**How do you guys prevent non-technical errors and bugs ?**

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a data-scientist in a junior position. My typical workflow consist of the following steps :

 1) the client gives us a problem 

2) think about proper methodology 

3) gather the data necessary to solve the problem 

4) apply some statistical procedures to solve the problem (generally a model) 

5) build a report to send to the client (this report must follow the company's format and standards).

One aspect where I notice I am having difficulties or improvement are in what I will call the non-technical or non-statistical aspects of the workflow above. That is suppose you gather the right data and think about the proper methodology to solve the problem, but then how can I prevent errors on the coding and reporting, for instance:

\- you have the right methodology, but when you are coding the model you assign a wrong variable in the code in some step and then the results are not valid ( for instance you have x\_train and x\_test and you mistakenly do m = x\_test / 2 instead of m = x\_train / 2).

\- on the reporting stage, you exported the wrong results.

These are just examples.

Then you send your report and under scrutiny from your managers or revising things to answer additional questions you find this errors. Then it looks unprofessional to say that the initial results were wrong and you will have to update it. It may not inspire much confidence in your results in the future.

It has been hard for me to find ways to improve in this aspect because these types of errors are hard to predict. When you are coding you are already doing what you think it is correct. Given the time frames we have, it is also unfeasible to double check every single line of code. Also, the problems are generally very diverse in nature, so it is not like you can just adopt an automated or semi-automated methodology that you can work upon and improve, many things you have to build from scratch every time you receive a new project.

* Top 1% on Stack Overflow (I answer a lot of SQL and Python questions, also ask some)
* Nearly 10 internal Trade Secrets awarded to products I have built

* Also have security related certifications (Security+)
* I mentor both the cybersecurity and AI clubs for my high school (along with a few other alumni)

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for. However, the recruiter mentioned almost 60% more than I make now, so that was enticing.

I feel technically sound -- but I definitely don't know how succinctly I could give an answer to some technical questions. I've looked at:

Are these good resources? Should I be prepared to write an algorithm from scratch? Would it be easier things, like kmeans, or am I expected to code backprop from scratch? I've done these things from scratch before, but I used reference material... I am nervous about not being able to demonstrate my skills because of being too focused on providing these overly technical answers.

EDA revisited,Discussion,"As we know, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a very common procedure in the field. We use it mainly to find inconsistencies in the data, to uncover simple patterns that could alter our perceptions of what we are dealing with and to build insightful visualizations. I think we can all agree how this type of information can be critical. What I would like to do here, and I hope you bear with me, is to question what seems to me a overly optimistic application of this technique.

So, a little context. I've been working on a small consultant startup that leverage data science techniques to serve our costumers. As you can probably guess, most of our services involve helping our clients make sense of their data and extract useful information that can maximize their profits. 

In the project I'm in, for 3 months we have been doing EDA and communicating our results through Power Point presentations. Although sometimes we could find something that was potentially interesting, this experience left me questioning the value of EDA when applied in isolation. 

To explicit my argument, let's go through an example: suppose I have a database with 20 variables and my goal is to find ""something interesting"". What we usually do is trying to find correlations between these variables (be it in form of graphs of statistical tests). Suppose that I find a positive correlation between X and Y, though. What is this really saying to me? How is this accounting for confounding variables and how much variance is it capturing? My bosses don't seem to me very concerned with these questions and usually think the finding of a correlation is already an insightful thing to communicate. 

I have been trying to argument with them that no analysis could be detached from previsibility. If this variable is correlated with the outcome, but it isn't helping to predict it, then why are we so focused on it? My concerns are usually met with the same answers: ""it is important to visualize what is happening"", ""we are still exploring our data"". 

This makes me think that my approach (predictability in the first place) is kind of unusual in the field? It appears to me that EDA has became a branch of data science that is not connecting very well with everything and is becoming embedded in some other kind of rules? 

I would love to hear your opinions about it.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gtjczf/eda_revisited/,4,datascience,know eda exploratory data analysis common procedure field use mainly find inconsistency data uncover simple pattern could alter perception dealing build insightful visualization think agree type information critical would like hope bear question seems overly optimistic application technique little context working small consultant startup leverage data science technique serve costumer probably guess service involve helping client make sense data extract useful information maximize profit project month eda communicating result power point presentation although sometimes could find something potentially interesting experience left questioning value eda applied isolation explicit argument let go example suppose database variable goal find something interesting usually trying find correlation variable form graph statistical test suppose find positive correlation x though really saying accounting confounding variable much variance capturing boss seem concerned question usually think finding correlation already insightful thing communicate trying argument analysis could detached previsibility variable correlated outcome helping predict focused concern usually met answer important visualize happening still exploring data make think approach predictability first place kind unusual field appears eda became branch data science connecting well everything becoming embedded kind rule would love hear opinion,eda revisited
Well today was a depressing day for data science at work. What can I do better?,Discussion,"I work as an Analytics Manager and normally I don't really share with my colleagues the in depth details of my work because nobody is technical. They just know I use SQL and Python to spit out a report and that's all they really understand.

Recently I had an opportunity to do something interesting where I had a very skewed data set and was asked to make sense of it. I thought applying a log transformation to normalize the data as the distribution was extremely skewed and thought it would make the data easier to interpret and I was happy with the results.

My colleagues wanted to know how I arrived at my conclusion for my recommendation so I walked them through the process. I provided a high level overview, but they really wanted to get into the nitty gritty of exactly HOW I got to where I got. Again, I normally don't like to do this because they tend ask very detailed questions like ""Can you explain exactly how this works so I can understand?"" and it gets tough to explain certain things (e.g., I would say something like ""I got this raw data from the API"" but then it's followed up by a question like ""What is an API and why didn't you just use the vendor's dashboard? Why doesn't the vendor's interface provide the data? Why do you have to go through this step?"").

Well anyway I was explaining my logic and really tip toed around the stats by really trying to say essentially that I applied some logic that would more even distribute the data. I stupidly said the word ""log"" and it was over. Their faces froze for a good 10 seconds before someone spoke.

""I'm sorry..but what? What is log? Why do you need this log? I'm really confused. How am I suppose to explain this to the SVP? Can you just change it so you're indexing off the median or mean? This doesn't make any sense.""

I'm dead.

So guys, how do you avoid getting away with having to explain things by  not using technical jargon? I mean like I said, I normally just show people the output of my report and I don't get too many in depth questions about it, but when people really pry, it gets tough. I don't know how to avoid saying ""I ran a regression model"" because it freaks people out and they get upset because they don't understand it and want me to do something that is easier to interpret. It's already frustrating that they think I'm over complicating things by using Python instead of Excel, but I can at least tell them certain things like Excel can't handle 1+ million rows and they can understand that.

EDIT: Hey all, appreciate all you feedback, both positive and negative. I think it's all constructive. There's a lot of replies in this thread so it's hard to answer everyone's questions. Some of you ask the same things and I do answer them, but you might have to dig through the comments to find it. In any case, let me post some frequently asked ones:

1) Did you use graphs and visuals?

Answer: I did. I actually stayed away from using the word log at first and just showed them a histogram of what the data looked like before the log transform and then after the log transform. What followed up was ""How did you do this? What did you use to index the numbers?"" And that's when I mentioned I used a log transformation.

2) How did you explain what a log transform was?

Answer: I didn't directly explain it in math terms. I described it in the form of an analogy or comparable example. This is what I said: 

""Imagine we were looking at salaries for a company. Most people for example will make a salary between something like $40 - 100k right? Well what if the top execs in the company make like $10 million dollars. Now imagine you tried to index using the mean? Wouldn't the mean say the average employee at this company makes a salary of $1 million dollars or something? That's not right. Basically, a log transformation would keep everyone's differences in consideration, but minimize the importance of some of those execs who are not entirely representative of the rest of the company. That way you can better see the difference in salary among every worker and not have your vision obscured by some of these execs who are throwing off that balance. ""

Unfortunately, this proved to be even more confusing and my colleagues really zoned in on exactly what a log was and how it's calculated and it was tough to navigate from there.

3) What is SVP?

Answer: It stands for Senior Vice President.

K-Means vs vector quantization,Discussion,"Howdy,

So, everyone knows about K-Means as a form of general clustering algorithm. Vector quantization is similarly centroid based, but rather uses a feed forward network to generate that Veroni styled segregation pattern via a (for lack of a better phrase) loser takes all output.

Is there any significant difference in these two algorithms? They seem like they would both have similar results; they both use random starting states, and rely on small adjustments potentially locking them in local minima. It seems like the only real difference is that k means is simpler, more efficient, and more direct.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gt7wv3/kmeans_vs_vector_quantization/,2,datascience,howdy everyone know k mean form general clustering algorithm vector quantization similarly centroid based rather us feed forward network generate veroni styled segregation pattern via lack better phrase loser take output significant difference two algorithm seem like would similar result use random starting state rely small adjustment potentially locking local minimum seems like real difference k mean simpler efficient direct,k mean v vector quantization
Worst example of data stupidity you have seen?,Discussion,"**It's Friday, lets vent!**

Will share my story but heavily changed to protect the guilty.  

I work(ed) in a safety field where people die based on decisions. We risk rate things, and use our limited resources to prioritise what we need to fix. For arguments sake, I have put this in the context of safety of vehicles.

Someone in another department came up with a subjective but otherwise understandable way of risk rating. Things  like 

* if there are seatbelts, subtract 1
* add the number of accidents in the last year
* if there is speed monitoring, subtract 1
* if no licence is required, add 2
* subtract 1 for every time they have been inspected  


As you can see, some of these were real numbers, some ordinal, some categorical and so on.

These numbers are added to give a final ""risk"" score for a vehicle. So far, so dodgy.

However, this total ""number"" was then ranked, and then multiplied by the number of passengers to give an overall value, which was then multiplied by the amount of safety dollars we had to spend to work out what we should do.

Needless to say, my mood quickly went from appalled to ""holy shit we need to never let anyone outside the organisation see how we do this...""",102,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gsqs45/worst_example_of_data_stupidity_you_have_seen/,78,datascience,friday let vent share story heavily changed protect guilty work ed safety field people die based decision risk rate thing use limited resource prioritise need fix argument sake put context safety vehicle someone another department came subjective otherwise understandable way risk rating thing like seatbelt subtract add number accident last year speed monitoring subtract licence required add subtract every time inspected see real number ordinal categorical number added give final risk score vehicle far dodgy however total number ranked multiplied number passenger give overall value multiplied amount safety dollar spend work needle say mood quickly went appalled holy shit need never let anyone outside organisation see,worst example data stupidity seen

Convention on Multiple Imputation for ML models?,Discussion,"Hi guys, I'm trying to build a binary outcome classifier for a dataset and I'm kind of stumped by a particular feature in the data which have \~20% of its values missing in both the training and testing sets. This feature has about a r=0.077 correlation with the outcome (measured from observed data in the training set).

I'm looking to do Multiple Imputation on the missing values and I gather that I basically need to do the following:

1. Choose a single imputation method with a random component (regression with random error term, regression with bootstrap samples, etc.), impute missing values x times to get x separate datasets
2. Do my analysis (build an ML model) x times to get x different sets of results (model parameters)
3. Average the results to get 1 set of model parameters

I was wondering if it would be okay if I just did step 1 and averaged the missing values into 1 complete dataset? I ask because this seems like it may not be worth the hassle for something with only a r=0.077 with the outcome, and coupled with missing values in other features I would end up with a lot of models if I chose this approach.

Cloud permissions for Data Scientists - anyone happy with their company's setup?,Discussion,"A recurring issue I've had to deal with in my career has been IT governance and the ability of myself (or my teams) to be able to use or test out cloud functionality independently (i.e., not needing IT to set everything up for my first).

For those in companies with tight permission policies:

1. How is your access to cloud resources set up?
   1. Are you able to spin up compute resources by yourself (e.g., EC2)?
   2. Are you able to connect these compute resources to production DBs, or are you only able to create these in dev environments/connect to test/backup DBs?
2. Are you happy with it?

EDIT for clarification:

* I am not advocating against IT governance - I think it certainly has a purpose and just giving users ""God privileges"" as u/lacompacida so eloquently referred to is not the answer. What I am interested in is how others (companies) are managing the tradeoff between cybersecurity risks and data scientist's autonomy.
* For example, I think u/SlightBerry brings up what seems like a valid stance - users should be able to deploy resources as needed, and security should be handled not by overseeing what users are spinning up, but by making sure that whatever they spin up is isolated enough not to generate issues.

How deep is your statistics knowledge?,Discussion,"I work a lot with ""heavy"" statisticians (mostly bio-statisticians). They typically get involve after we do all the data engineering and NLP part. Their knowledge of stats of course overshadows that of my team, which brings me to the question - what is the value of a data scientist without such knowledge?

It's true that we do all the heavy work, but the statisticians are the ones making the calls about the study design, scrutinize the results etc. 

It makes my teammate feel like low-skilled workers in the whole process, and they fear that they will be easily replaceable.

Strategies for processing .csv files over 1 million rows long (~200 MB .csv files),Discussion,"At my job, I am juggling keeping our development pace going for the project I'm assigned to while making improvements to our workflow.

I figured out that you can dump a .csv file of a waveform from an [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope), and it is over a million rows. Python is too slow, because I only have access to a dual core 4 GB machine (I am thinking about writing a persuasive letter about getting a cheap 16 GB ram machine with secure, local-only remote access for the entire engineering team, probably either a quad core Intel or Ryzen 3600) so I was wondering what would be best:

*Learn some [R lang](https://www.r-project.org/) basics? C++ was the first thing that came to mind because I figured I could just declare 300-400 MB of memory, placing the whole .csv file in 200 and the rest of the program in 100-200? [This is the second link that comes up for me when I google ""C++ .csv"".](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/reading-and-writing-csv-files-with-cpp/) Admittedly, he has a point. I am about using the right tool for a job.

*Learn [Postgres](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/)? I like the idea of having an excuse to put a database on my resume and then interfacing it with my tried-and-true Python or C++. 

*Go with my first instinct and [do it in C++ anyways](https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser)?

Is it possible to predict a specific date for a customer's next transaction (with some margin of error) ?,Discussion,"I have a dataset of bill payment transactions of our customers with a period of over 1 year and some features like paid amount, transaction date, bill type (power, internet, etc.).

(\*\*) I'm not sure how one would reformulate and approach this 'new' problem, and how one would backtest/validate the model (what would be the metrics, etc.). Any pointers or ideas would be appreciated.

Edit: I did do some feature engineering in order to fit a gradient boosting into the data for (\*) and came up with some aggregated features (per customer) including:

\- recency 

\- frequency

\- customer age (time from first transaction to the end of the studied period)

\- statistics of the bill amount (mean, median, kurtosis, min, max, etc.)

\- statistics of the day difference between bill payments

\- Mode of bill types

\- Counts of each bill type, normalised

One thing that confuses me a bit: There are some customers with zero day differences, meaning they paid 2 or more bills in 1 day.

Making exploratory Jupyter notebooks more production friendly,Discussion,"Hello,

I've been hearing polarising opinions on using using Jupyter notebooks in production. My read is that people generally agree on notebooks being useful for exploratory analysis, but the path from there to production seems very vague and very different for different workflows.

Here is what I've found quite useful for my team, made of data analysts, data scientists and me as production engineer. We start from notebooks and gradually end up with code in .py files. It usually involves a hybrid setup of Jupyter web UI and VsCode connected remotely to SageMaker machine, opening the same dir notebooks are in.

There is not quantitative data to back it up, but I feel it didn't decrease the iteration speed and it definitely avoids a lot of ""translation"" from what they write into production code.

What are your thoughts on this?

Do you do something similar?

Is your data setup so complex that it's almost impossible to move from notebook to the production code?

How do you iterate on products where the initial exploration is needed?

How do you make sure there is no loss in the ""translation process""?

""Under no circumstances should someone claim credit for someone else's work. I was involved in litigation against Google for something similar over 10 years ago.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day. Once again, my apologies for my failed try at providing you time-saving value and exposure. Site is down, time-saving, content aggregating, author visibility-enhancing site is no longer available.

What clustering algorithm is recommended for such a large number of samples? What would give me a reasonable run time, while also dealing with the fact that I don't just have continuous, numerical data?

Get Use Out of Exponential Probability Distribution,Projects,"Hello fellow data people. I was recently working with a dataset I had cleaned up and filtered.

See what I did there? I posted a link with a bit of an explanation. That's fine. If you want to know more, you have to go to their content on their site. We all do that in our social media feeds. Putting all their content on my site so readers don't need to go to theirs is theft. It doesn't matter if I put the attribution somewhere with the post. No permission=theft.

When another site wants to repost something I've written, they send me a message and ask for permission. That's been the way it is done for the eight years I have been writing. With a site like KDNuggets, I am always good with giving them the OK and not asking for compensation. Some major outlets will ask me to rebuild a post to appeal to their target audience. They have millions of readers. I do that for free too.

I have worked with consulting companies. They want content to drive people to their site as a form of organic marketing. It's usually pretty fluffy, buzzword bingo type posts. I get paid for that. If someone is advertising their services on the site, they are making money off that site and you should too.

I have worked with companies that make products. They want technical content to explain how to use their product in the real world. Again, they use that content to market their products. I get paid for that and you should too.

In the research world, works are cited. There can be a longer quotation from the original work which will have the primary authors' names next to it. Supporting works without quotes will be linked to at the end of the research paper. That's fine. Copy paste research, paraphrasing, releasing implementations as original works, all of that is plagiarism. That gets you blacklisted.

I have posted content that was very close to someone else's. They posted first. I issued an apology and a link to their content. It happens. The right response is to put your hand up and say, ""I messed up. I must have seen their post and that triggered mine."" No excuses. I felt like garbage for doing it.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

Advice? I like Time Series but don't have experience in it (just in other stuff),Career,"TLDR; DS working at a bank with images/nlp but having an affair with Time Series (I love this). Haven't found a job on that (so no experience) and recently found a position at the current workplace involved with Risk (might not have ts either). Seeking for advice. 

Hello everyone! 

I'm a DS working at an important Bank in my country. Here I've been dealing with solving problems with unstructured data, like videos, images and text. It's being interesting, but I feel quite unsatisfied. I mean, I studied economics and I'm doing a MSc in Statistics. I love time series in a theoretical way, since I can't find a job that works with them. 

I thought that working at a bank would be cool and have some forecast related projects I could work on... but I couldn't work on any.  

You see in my department there are many areas for data analysis, but not for data modeling, except mine and other. The other area makes churn models, and sometimes recommendation systems. 

I feel I'm taking a wrong path for my future. I have no finance related experience (images, text?) Neither time series Modelling experience (aside from the theoretical one). 

I want to change and I recently found a position at the bank that deals with Risk and I think I might go for it (it's no time series related, but is bank related).  But my boss and the director of the area I work on don't want me to move. They say they really like my work, and that we have many projects we can work on, particularly since my area is gaining a lot of credibility. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if the position in Risk involves modelling and predicting as much as I'd like, or if it will just be analyzing and giving back raw numbers. 

Should I stay and keep looking for TS related jobs, or change to the Risk to gain insights and learn from the bank duties and may find place for forecasting? Should I just take this, grow in this side and hope to find something in the future? 

I'm very confused.

For instance, ""months since last delinquency"" feature only applies to those borrowers which have a delinquency on their record. Imputing a value of 0 would imply those with no delinquencies are the same as those with an extremely recent delinquency, and imputing a very large value (say 9999) just doesn't sit right with me. My only other idea was to introduce an ordinal feature instead of a numeric one, binning delinquency recency by say ""never"", ""&lt;1 year"", ""1-2 years"", ""3-4 years"" etc. The issue I have with that is I would be deciding the cut off points at the expense of granularity, while it may be better to let the module ""learn"" those cutoff points.

"How do you organise your data science projects? Code, data, learnings.",Discussion,"Coming from the engineering field where the main artefacts of work are source code and production systems, I sometimes feel a bit short in processes around organising and saving the work my team does.

I've noticed there are several types of projects:

* once off data analysis
* exploration that leads to a feature shipped in a product
* explorations that never get shipped
* data analysis for debugging purposes. Let's say we run an A/B test and want to figure out whether we set it up correctly. We won't really share results outside of the team.

I guess different project will possibly get different answers, but let's kick off with these questions:

* where do you store the sidecar data? We store the code on GitHub, but don't want to package the data with the code (security/compliance reasons)
* do you make all your explorations reproducible? For example, a piece of code calls the warehouse. Do you store the snapshot of the data somewhere so you know exactly what was analysed?
* do you store all analysis you perform? For example, exec asks you for some numbers for a PPT
* do you keep track of different experiments? What do you use for that? Notion/Confluence/Gdocs/something ML specific?

What's R good for?,Discussion,"I can't figure out what's the great advantage of R over Python. 

R is a single-use language, Python can be used on way more things than just data science. 

Plotting is not harder in Python. 

Libraries are also not a problem in Python. In fact I'd say being a general purpose language, there's way more libraries for way more uses for Python than R. 

Is it the build-in datasets? But I don't care about iris flowers, I have my own problem to solve. And even if I do care, I can easily download it from the internet.

What setup should I use for matching and monitoring this project?,Projects,"I need to establish a framework for formatting, matching and tracking changes to a dataset that can only be accessed through a CSV-file. I know how to do that using Excel and VBA, but I was wondering if there isn't a better way.

The problems goes:

1. The goal is to gather a weekly COMPANY : SHARES summary (could be limited to 30 pre-selected companies).
2. Twice a year I get a COMPANY : FUND overview.
3. I can pull an extensive dataset (around 54k obs) structured as FUND : SHARES, but the dataset FUND-string often also includes a lot of noise, such as the company address, company name, telephone etc.
4. To aggregate COMPANY : SHARES, I thus need to match COMPANY : FUND by scanning through the dataset FUND string and match with keywords relating to each specific company (such as a fund name, or the company's own name).
5. Because of the bad quality of the dataset, I will need to manually look at the results of the sorting to adjust the keywords for faulty matches, e.g. a new fund has been attributed because it matched with the company name keyword, but the string also includes some info which makes it clear that it shouldn't have been matched here so I include a non-match keyword filter it out from being matched with that company. This is unfortunate, but bearable as a total of \~200 funds are matched if the number of companies are limited to 30.

I know how to do streamline most of this process with some hassle using Excel Power Query for formatting and importing the CSV, VBA for for matching the data and a Pivot Table for creating a summary. I also know some Python and have SQL experience. I see how SQL would ease the sorting, but I would still need to manually download and format the CSV before feeding it into, say, MS Access. It would be so nice with a setup where I could more easily set the company match/don't-match keywords, see exactly which rows has been matched per company from the dataset, adjust keywords and re-run, and maybe even point out new matches that wasn't there last time it was run.

I would be very grateful for any tips or ideas.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gktz5p/what_setup_should_i_use_for_matching_and/,3,datascience,need establish framework formatting matching tracking change dataset accessed csv file know using excel vba wondering better way problem go goal gather weekly company share summary could limited pre selected company twice year get company fund overview pull extensive dataset around k ob structured fund share dataset fund string often also includes lot noise company address company name telephone etc aggregate company share thus need match company fund scanning dataset fund string match keywords relating specific company fund name company name bad quality dataset need manually look result sorting adjust keywords faulty match e g new fund attributed matched company name keyword string also includes info make clear matched include non match keyword filter matched company unfortunate bearable total fund matched number company limited know streamline process hassle using excel power query formatting importing csv vba matching data pivot table creating summary also know python sql experience see sql would ease sorting would still need manually download format csv feeding say m access would nice setup could easily set company match match keywords see exactly row matched per company dataset adjust keywords run maybe even point new match last time run would grateful tip idea,setup use matching monitoring project

Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,Discussion,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful?

"I'm sick of ""AI Influencers"" - especially ones that parade around with a bunch of buzzwords they don't understand!",Networking,"This is going to come off as salty. I think it's meant to? This is a throwaway because I'm a fairly regular contributor with my main account.

I have a masters degree in statistics, have 12+ years of experience in statistical data analysis and 6+ in Machine Learning. I've built production machine learning models for 3 FAANG companies and have presented my work in various industry conferences. It's not to brag, but to tell you that I have actual industry experience. And despite all this, I wouldn't dare call myself an ""AI Practitioner, let alone ""AI Expert"".

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

"Designing a Small, Scalable Data Pipeline on a Budget",Projects,"I work at a small, grassroots nonprofit youth center that provides afterschool and summer camp programming to middle school students in the inner city. I was hired on full-time as their ""Data Analyst,"" however, they had no prior systems, databases, or even spreadsheets, so I inevitably ended up becoming a one-man data team (which I actually am enjoying).

I built a small system of google sheets &amp; forms to collect our student data (attendance, grades, behavior, etc), volunteer data (attendance, skills, etc), and program data (performance evaluation), but I would like to migrate to a more centralized solution that is scalable. The organization plans on scaling and replicating this model around the city, so it would be ideal to have a scalable, replicable data system to accommodate that goal.

My question is this: Are there any open-source/low-cost solutions for building a network of automatable data systems to fit this use-case? Something like a cross-platform app that we can read, write, modify, and delete data with and store in a sort of simplified document system like JSON or Firebase. Since I don't plan on staying here forever, I'd like to build it so it can be used by someone with any level of proficiency in programming.

I welcome any collaborators or advisors, and I'd love to work together to figure this out for a great organization that does great work for the community.

What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,Discussion,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with.

Off My Chest. After almost 9+ face-to-face interviews I cannot even get a simple entry level Data Analyst job for almost 7 months now.

For a entry level analyst role I have the skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python, I even did a tableau course on Analysis/ Data Science.  One of my concern is my in depth knowledge on the tools and programs above as I have no idea how to compare myself to another analyst.

I have a speech impediment which as expected gets worse during interviews as I have to think on my feet really quickly. I feel like I struggle with the competency-based questions, because due to my stammer I cannot use the STAR method correctly. Most of my feedback from the interviews were I wasn't the right candidate and other had fit the bill etc etc. ""you weren't confident, and they felt I wasn't strong enough"". I have never doubted myself nor have I lost confidence.

Especially during the lock-down, it’s hard for me to get an interview as most companies are closed and those that are still hiring start from a telephone call. In terms of landing an interview I have refined my CV with professional help and most interview reaches the face-to-face stage.

For those on the hiring side: how do you deal with incoming or prospective data scientists with little to no communication skills?,Discussion,"**BG:** I'm a director of data science at a global Fortune 500 firm and am constantly on the lookout for talent (barring currently with the virus).  I recruit pretty heavily with prestigious universities in the U.S. out of their data science programs.

**Issue:**  I find it is difficult as a needle in a haystack to find qualified data scientists with proper communication skills and general business sense.  Many of these recruits have their data science masters degrees and quite of few of them have their bachelors in some sort of business degree. Many others have engineering or statistical backgrounds.

I will often get a stack of dozens of resumes each with all the check marks crossed in terms of programming and courses but when I go to speak to the students it is a near disaster.  I ask them to explain very simple concepts and they often go off on 5 minute answers that are rambling and incoherent.  I need these candidates to be able to communicate across different sides of the business, often times with individuals that have little to no understanding of data science.

Data Integration Help,Tooling,"Hi!  I'm hoping someone can help me or provide some insight.  I work with a partner agency that is hoping to improve dataset integration. Briefly, they have one system that creates a user id and documents some information (this is related to covid testing and contact tracing). There is another system they use essentially like a service management tool. It takes data from system 1 (e.g. name, phone, tested positive) and uses this additional system to document case notes and provide service work updates (e.g. patient has not exhibited symptoms in three days).

Here's the issue:  the agency is manually exporting data from system one and uploading into system two nightly.  They use SAS for this, but i'm not sure how (I've only ever used SAS for analytics like MLR, cluster analysis, etc.).  

They need a faster and less manual way to integrate the data.  Ideally when one system is updated, the other is also updated much quicker than overnight and less manually (than export, import, matching, etc.).

I don't have a lot of specifics here; my agency was just brought on to help and i do not yet have information like metric names/types, job/etl schedule, etc.

Does anyone have any experience, insight, or suggestions?  I would appreciate it!

"Data scientists/analysts who moved to Pandas from Excel, what operations do you find can be done much more easily in Pandas than Excel.",Discussion,"Hello everyone,

I have been working as a data analyst for about 3 years and about 2 years ago I switched to Pandas due to how much potential it had to improve my life: I am very bad at cataloging and record keeping, so doing things in Pandas makes everything so traceable and reproducible for me. Plus Excel always becomes super slow for me when the rows surpass 80K.

This week I will give my team members a quick demonstration of Pandas's capabilities. A lot of my team members use Excel for most of their data analysis, so I'd like to show them some handy operations that can be done by Pandas in much shorter time, hence improving our efficiency.

Several operations I have in mind are:

* The magic power of `unstack` to move columns into rows, usually accompanying `set_index()` and `groupby`.
* `df.duplicated()`, esp if I want to find the rows that have duplicate values in some columns, I can do `df[df.duplicated(['A', 'B'], keep=False)]`
* I always have to write a pretty long formula in Excel to find values in column A that is in or not in column B. I love how I can just do `df[~df.colA.isin(df1.colB)]`
* \`merge\` compared to `vlookup` or `indexmatch`

That's about what I have in mind right now. Some other operations like drop\_duplicates() or sum()  can be done not without too much effort in Excel. I don't think I need to talk about groupby() as we all use SQL on a regular basis.

Would anyone care to give me some additional examples please?

Improving Presentation Skills,Career,"Hi everyone. Hope everyone is doing okay during these strange times. I have a few questions about presentation skills:

What kinds of presentation skills do you find most important to hone at work? What did you do to develop these skills? And finally, how do you deal with fear of public speaking? 

The latter is something I struggle with immensely. I spend a lot of time familiarizing myself with the topic I plan to present, organizing my materials so they “tell a story”, practice giving mock presentations and try to think of questions that the audience may ask. I feel comfortable with the knowledge, but find myself freezing up once I actually have to present. I’ve always struggled with performance anxiety. My heart starts pounding, my palms get sweaty, and I start getting tunnel vision. This seems to happen regardless of how much preparation I do.

Improving on this is one of my number 1 goals over the next year or so! If you have any advice or stories to share, please do!

Leaving your datascientist position to create your own business - what are the key factor to succeed? what are the risks?,Career,"I am working as a data scientists for a top strategy consulting firm. In overall, it is a decent job but I need to face reality, my company is not a tech company and I am bit concerned about the career path in the long term. Though the remuneration/benefits are good wrt to the data science market in my geography, I  feel that the analytics team members are somehow second class citizens wrt to the core consultants. They get huge bonus, we don t. They can make it to the partner level, we can't. 
The good thing about consulting is that you get exposed to a myriad of problems, so you get quickly get an idea of the needs of an industry. There are 2/3 use cases that come back frequently and honestly, the way we tackle these is pretty basic and leaves a lot of space for further improvement. Indeed, we are generally working on projects with very tight deadlines, pushing us to choose one-shot, quick-win approaches. As a consequence, we are constantly reinventing the wheel since most of the previous code base is too specific and can't be easily reused on a new project.
I am therefore sometimes thinking of leaving the company and create my own product. A better product that can be re used across use cases. 
I am therefore very interested to hear about similar experiences, to hear about people that have left their jobs to create their own business (ideally in the field of data science).

Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,Education,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

Work repeatedly lied to me about ability to transition and now I'm stuck in a role I hate with a bad economy,Career,"Hello everyone,

So a bit of backstory. I started in my current role roughly nine months ago. During the interview process I made it extremely clear I wanted a data science position (particularly one that involved a lot of machine learning) but the recruiter said there were no openings on data science. She and the others I talked with did say my role would primarily revolve around deploying models into production and not building pipelines and I could transition to data science once there became openings. I did have another full-time data science offer, however it was in a different city. Therefore, I was faced with a tough decision and based both on location and their 'promises' I chose my current role. 

However, in the first few months after starting I realized three things: (1) I wouldn't be deploying any models to production as the DS team had absolutely no models past the prototyping stage (and nine months later they still don't), (2) several others were brought onto the DS team right around when I started, (3) several of the people on DS including the DS lead seemed extremely weak in terms of actual machine learning knowledge. In retrospect this should have been a red-flag but I still hoped I could move off of data engineering and get into data science going. (Also, several of my previous roles had been on contracts, so I wanted to hold down a position for at least a year and not look like a job hopper.)

 Throughout Nov/Dec I tried unsuccessfully to get put on data science projects. This was particularly frustrating as I have expertise in several areas of modeling where the company is struggling. 

Moreover, they transferred several engineers with absolutely no DS background onto DS just because they apparently had nothing better to do with them. However, they kept promising my time would come. Finally, in Feb/Mar they brought me on to a couple of projects aimed at the knowledge graph, apparently because I was the only one in the entire organization with NLP experience. I was happy to work on that but they made it clear that my primary responsibilities for the time being were still data engineering. I asked them if they had plans to hire someone full time to data engineering so I could move over and they said yes. 

Now to the present. They tell me to stop all data science work because they want me 100% focused on data engineering. They come up with some flimsy excuse about the economy and DE needing to be my focus. They also make some references to needing to improve my data engineering performance. (My performance review was perfectly fine. Plus I made it clear to them when I was interviewing DE/ETL was not my strong suit.) Moreover, they still apparently have the resources to hire a full-time data scientist (WTF? they couldn't have hired another data engineer and transitioned me).The data science manager (who still hasn't produced one concrete ML deliverable) literally sits as the product owner of data engineering. At any point he could have prioritized hiring another data engineer so I could move over. I'm beyond frustrated that they have lied to me since day one. However, now the economy is bad and I can't quit outright. I have had  a couple interviews, but I have a number of thing working against me (bad economy, data engineering job title, short current job stay).",145,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gb41m8/work_repeatedly_lied_to_me_about_ability_to/,48,datascience,hello everyone bit backstory started current role roughly nine month ago interview process made extremely clear wanted data science position particularly one involved lot machine learning recruiter said opening data science others talked say role would primarily revolve around deploying model production building pipeline could transition data science became opening another full time data science offer however different city therefore faced tough decision based location promise chose current role however first month starting realized three thing deploying model production d team absolutely model past prototyping stage nine month later still several others brought onto d team right around started several people d including d lead seemed extremely weak term actual machine learning knowledge retrospect red flag still hoped could move data engineering get data science going also several previous role contract wanted hold position least year look like job hopper throughout nov dec tried unsuccessfully get put data science project particularly frustrating expertise several area modeling company struggling moreover transferred several engineer absolutely d background onto d apparently nothing better however kept promising time would come finally feb mar brought couple project aimed knowledge graph apparently one entire organization nlp experience happy work made clear primary responsibility time still data engineering asked plan hire someone full time data engineering could move said yes present tell stop data science work want focused data engineering come flimsy excuse economy de needing focus also make reference needing improve data engineering performance performance review perfectly fine plus made clear interviewing de etl strong suit moreover still apparently resource hire full time data scientist wtf hired another data engineer transitioned data science manager still produced one concrete ml deliverable literally sits product owner data engineering point could prioritized hiring another data engineer could move beyond frustrated lied since day one however economy bad quit outright couple interview number thing working bad economy data engineering job title short current job stay,work repeatedly lied ability transition stuck role hate bad economy

Seeking Advice: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses and is pressuring me with deadlines. What to do?,Career,"I work as a data scientist at a medium-sized company (with \~200 employees). I've been with the company for a little over 4 months. My salary is $90K/year in a city where the cost of living is relatively cheap. (For perspective, $1200/month for 2-bedroom-2-bathroom apartment.) I have a BI analyst as my boss and I have another boss who's a BI director.

The BI team in our office is small. Just 3 of us in the office. The issue I have is that my bosses don't understand the complexity of running a valid analysis, which is forcing me to cut corners and produce sub-par quality work. Those sub-par quality analyses then get criticized by people in other departments (e.g. finance people, data scientists in other offices, etc.) and it makes me look like an idiot.

Don't get me wrong. My bosses are hardworking, smart people. They can write complex SQL code and make stunningly beautiful Tableau dashboards. However, they don't have any statistical background to properly design studies and go through the proper procedures to come to accurate conclusions. But they care too much about how beautiful the presentations must be (font, color, company branding, etc.) and meeting deadlines instead of focusing on the important stuffs, like valid experimental procedures and properly separating out correlation from causation.

I would say that the overall company culture is very healthy. The CEO is super transparent about the company matters. Everyone is very open and caring. The company sent a lot of care packages during the quarantine for the employees and they also host weekly fun company-wide activities. They give great medical and health benefits as well as PTO.

I thought about quitting because not having enough time and resources that I need to do my job is making me look incompetent. I haven't quit yet because:

1. I don't think many other companies are hiring amid this quarantine crisis,
2. I have a criminal background so I'm not sure if there is any other company that's willing to risk hiring me.

What should I do? At this rate, I'm gonna continue looking like an idiot and maybe I'll lose my job.

TLDR: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses so I'm producing sub-par quality work. What should I do?

UPDATE: Thank you so much to all of you who shared valuable feedback!! I feel so much better after reading all your comments than before.

Feeling stuck since one year at data science job. Need career advice.,Career,"Pay: 80k. Medium col city YoE: 2.5

**TL;dr: DS job doesn't have ML/modelling work. Underpaid. Imposter syndrome kicking in. Want to switch jobs but afraid that I didn't build good experience to apply to bigger more challenging roles. Feeling stuck. Thinking of switching to swe since my statistics and ML growth hasn't been too good at current role. Need advice. More details below.**

I'm a data scientist, and I've been working on the same application for an year or two. I don't see it changing. Most of my experience has been writing spark code and  dev ops and cloud infra work for an application that we build. There's a bit of prototyping work here and there. And some business case development with upper management. The team is really small. And there are no senior members in the DS team. The only thing that I like about it is that I have positioned myself to become the most experienced person in the team on a product that we work on so i get to have a lot of say in the dev process.

I never go to do any ML or statistical modelling at this job. It was my first job after college, and I have severe imposter syndrome kicking in. So now I don't feel like a data scientist, and I'm becoming disillusioned with the field. My MS in data scientist is going to waste since I'm not using the ML and stats I learned. I am afraid to apply to other data science jobs since I feel that I will not be able to clear a DS interview round when it comes to describing what I've done with stats and ML and deep learning. I can study and practice sure but experience matters a lot, and if I don't have that, the only DS jobs I would be able to land in the future would be title inflated analyst roles.

I might switch to a software engineering role with maybe an ML focus because I fear I didn't build any relevant experience for the type of jobs that I want in DS but I have good experience and love writing python, plus coding in general. And I'm also tired of the lack of strong software dev practices in DS teams. I want to go somewhere where I can build things and code more than I do, with a more engineering focused team. Do you think DS jobs with actually challenging work will be harder to get into since I don't have modelling/ML experience?

My company is willing to start Green Card process, and then I'll be stuck here for a couple of years. At least my gc will process faster since processing dates for my nationality is current. It also makes staying at my current role more attractive since I don't know if newer companies would be willing to file GC straight away.

And then there is coronavirus.

Looking to pick up an additional language - I want to hear your actual experiences,Tooling,"Got my first job as a data analyst in 2010.  Between then and now, as a function of 1) me moving up in the ranks, 2) macro changes in the entire industry, my bread and butter software went from Excel -&gt; SPSS -&gt; SAS and SQL -&gt; Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm trying to be proactive, and start learning one or two new languages.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for a ""you should just learn X"" answer.  I want to hear some ""IF you learn X, you could do Y.""  I'm more interested in finding a Y I want to do, and then I'll just learn whatever X I need to be able to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I've been toying around with the idea of learning JavaScript, actually, precisely since most data type people don't know it, and I'm thinking that if I could do some cool interactive or data vizs or web apps, that could distinguish me from my peers.  So if I want to do more reporting and communication, JavaScript maybe would be the way to go?  Anyone have an anecdote that would back that idea up, or knock that idea down?

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, I'm thinking about R and Julia.  Right now, I'm a data analyst who only knows how to pandas.  So maybe if I want to go more the science route, I should pick up R or Julia?  (Or: I'm thinking being able to use Shiny and ggplot would let me do more interactives/viz, so have any Pythonistas out there had their life changed by the R, in that way?  Can you tell me about it?)

&amp;#x200B;

I also just started learning bash and awk.  Any data analysis type folks (but not database admin or ETL or IT type folks), discover that learning shell scripting solved a real problem they were having?  Enough to the point that its worth it to learn well?

Critique/help with the MLOps plan for a small DS team,Discussion,"I work for a small (~4 person) data science team within a much larger organization. The team is responsible for making two machine learning models, creating a single set of very important predicted values, and creating reporting and data validation tools relevant to those predicted values. I came on board about 4 months ago with experience in data science, systems administration, and devops. I have a strong linux background and plenty of experience with Docker and Kubernetes. 

I've been asked to improve the existing modeling pipeline. I've come up with a plan that I think is feasible given the organization's goals and (considerable) constraints, but I'm hoping to get feedback on potential pitfalls or things to add from people with more ML/dev ops experience than myself. I also thought it might be fun for this sub to think through what the ideal toolchain might be given a pretty serious set of constraints.

## Goals

- Make our pipeline more robust. No more undetected data issues or breaking commits. Automatic unit and integration tests on all commits/merge requests.
- Improve pipeline transparency and reporting. Make summary and performance statistics about each model more easily available.
- Make testing and comparing new models significantly easier. More clearly tie new model results/objects to the code that produced them.
- Make the whole pipeline run continuously and automatically (given new data or other triggers).

## Constraints

- No cloud infrastructure. Everything has to be on-prem.
- Absolutely no additional money. Zero.
- Need to keep the developer toolchain as light as possible. It has to be usable by a team with limited devops/linux experience.
- Infrastructure can be (and is) linux + Docker based, but it has to be simple enough that if I die it's easy to understand and maintain for someone with a moderate devops background. For the same reason, all infrastructure setup has to be infrastructure as code.
- Any rebuild has to be done within 6 months of one person's full time work. This includes all infrastructure setup, code refactoring, CI/CD setup, and new code.
- The pipeline/modeling itself has to be written in R.

## Tools Available

- Hardware is limited to 2 beefy SQL servers, 2 beefy Ubuntu VMs, and ~6 beefy Windows workstations. 
- We recently upgraded to GitLab Silver for the whole organization and have all the features that go along with it.

## Current Setup

This is a relatively new team that had to get something up and running quickly, so they haven't yet had the time or resources to setup a mature ML pipeline or incorporate many devops best practices. However, they're committed to improving things and making the best system possible, hence why they asked for this plan. The current pipeline is:

1. **Data extraction/processing.** Data is stored entirely in SQL and feature engineering/data extraction is done via SQL views. The view definitions are stored in GitLab. There is one SQL server that is used for both reporting and modeling. Data extraction takes a *very* long time.

2. **Modeling.** The entire pipeline is written in R and is stored in a single, large GitLab repo. Scripts are manually triggered sequentially to run the actual pipeline and modeling. Data ingest/validation, modeling, model validation, and reporting are all roughly part of the same repo. This repo has no unit testing or integration testing.

3. **Reporting.** Reporting is done via R Markdown and a set of Shiny apps that exist separately from the main modeling repo. These reporting applications pull from the same SQL server as the main modeling scripts and report on the predicted values created in the modeling step. Model performance metrics are not available to the reporting apps.

Other notes:

- Intermediate data and model objects are not saved. The model specification and performance statistics of the best performing model are saved to an excel sheet. The predicted values produced by this model are saved back to SQL.

- Testing new models and/or functional forms is done manually by editing the main repo's R code. Model outputs are not tied to specific commits or branches.

## Planned Improvements

Given my constraints, I'd like to make the following improvements:

- Disaggregate the steps of the pipeline into discrete repositories/tasks that can be individually run, tested, and worked on. Add unit testing to each of these repos that runs automatically (via GitLab CI/CD). 
- Create an R package or packages that contains widely used functions and small datasets. Also add unit testing to these repos.
- Create a separate SQL server that mirrors the original server and is used exclusively for reporting.
- Use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) (running in Docker on a VM) to store the intermediate data produced by each step in the pipeline as well the final model objects. This is to prevent people from needing to constantly re-run the same data ingest scripts.
- Use DVC to define clear DAGs that automate the process of running the pipeline and collecting metrics on the results. Upload model metrics to a new table in SQL.
- Again use DVC to tie model output and data to specific commits and branches.
- Using the model summary metrics in both DVC and SQL, add some sort of reporting dashboard (Tableau, Shiny) that facilitates easy comparison of different models.

Those are my immediate thoughts for improvements, but I'm curious to get this sub's take as well. Additionally, I'd love to find an ML ops mentor if someone out there is willing to teach/talk.

That said, I wanted to ask professionals/students alike in this community a couple questions regarding projects that involve games:

1. In the context of hiring, are DS/ML projects that involve games as valid as projects that don’t involve games?
2. For side projects in general, how long would a typically good project take? Does the time frame really matter?
3. What do recruiters/managers look for to measure good understanding in these DS/ML projects?
4. If you’re a student, what would be your concerns with projects like these? 

I personally think that properly applying DS/ML principles in an end-to-end project would be a valid talking point in any context. However, I’m a little biased so I definitely wanted to see what people thought.

Established Team or Wild West?,Career,"I have recently accepted an offer but current employer expressed interest to retain. Just want to pick some brains to see how people choose between a mature team and a brand new team.

First of all both are large companies that are not directly impacted by the disease.

My current team is very resourceful. I work with a group of PhD and masters, who are all extremely bright and have a lot I can learn from. I picked up a ton of knowledge just from being exposed to their work. 

The new offer I received is for a brand new ""data analytics"" team. There are a lot of potential for legitimate data science projects but the team is about .5 - 1 year away from having the right infrastructure (proper data warehouse, tooling, and culture).  Once that's fulfilled, the bulk of work will be in BI, with areas enhanced by machine learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I've been the dumbest person on the team for a while and it's time to branch out and try things on my own? With my current team, I don't get R&amp;D project and to be honest, I constantly feel the problems we're solving (deep learning, NLP) are too difficult for me. A big part of my work is in deploying and executing models, so they are software engineering-heavy in nature as oppose to business-related (which I prefer more).

With the new team, I have more say on directions and the type of projects the team should be doing. There will be more chances of identifying business opportunities and implementing a solution. The work seems to be more inclined to using traditional ML methods, which I'm more familiar with, but I'm certain I'll be fighting politics, budget, and maybe even struggling to come up with impactful ML solutions.

Does my current salary seem appropriate for my location &amp; experience?,Career,"I'm a Data Scientist in San Francisco, with a base salary of 150k. My company is a private mid-sized tech company, but not that well-known, so my equity doesn't seem to matter in counting.

For some context, I have under 2 years of experience working as a Data Scientist. I have a Masters and Bachelor's degree in pretty well-known schools, but these degrees aren't actually in data science or software engineering. I came into the workforce basically straight out of Master's. I would say I'm pretty proficient in ML, SQL, and Python, but my understanding of model deployment and cloud architecture is weak since I don't have an engineering degree. My strength is in analytics, business insights, and communication with external stakeholders (somewhat like sales).  

My day to day responsibilities runs wide, since it's not a big company. It's everything from data analysis, model training, A/B testing, dashboarding, etc.

Based on the above information, I'm wondering if my current base salary sounds appropriate to what what I am performing and where I'm located? Someone asked this question in cscareers subreddit, and I wanted to ask the same thing.

The reason I ask is due to what my peers seem to be making around the area. Buddies of mine from FANG are pretty vocal about making 250k straight out of college (of course, a lot of that comes from equity, but does it really matter?). I'm pretty content with my current company (our work hours are really good, like 9-5 without much stress).

Tell me why I should learn SQL (a little bit of a rant),Discussion,"TLDR is at the bottom,

Some background first, I've been working for almost two years as a Junior Data Scientist at a small IoT startup in Massachusetts doing mostly big data analysis with Apache Spark, and ML research/deployment with Amazon SageMaker. With the pandemic going on, and the market the way it is, not many investors are looking to fund new rounds right now, so things are getting pretty tight. Fortunately for me, the executive team is very transparent and let me know it might be time to start looking for something more stable for the time being.

Since then I've had more than a few technical interviews, and a lot of them haven't gone very well, mainly because my SQL skills are extremely basic at best. This isn't a problem at my current company because I use Apache PySpark for everything, I run it on an EMR cluster and it's usually faster than traditional SQL. I usually try to explain Spark to potential employers when they ask me about my SQL skills, but their response is usually like ""ok great, now solve this complex SQL problem anyway"".

In my opinion, PySpark is a faster alternative to raw SQL. I feel a bit frustrated because I feel like employers don't care or believe that I'm just as effective as someone with strong SQL skills.

TLDR:

Why should I learn what in my opinion is a slower alternative (SQL) to a tool I am already skilled with (PySpark)?

Am I wrong to believe I'm as effective as someone who is strong with SQL?

Why do employers insist that I must be skilled with SQL to be a good Data Scientist, even if I explain Apache Spark to them?

# Common Responses:

Really all the responses are in one of three bins

1. You need to learn SQL so you can (\*insert thing you use SQL to do\*)

My response is that I don't, I can use Spark to do almost any SQL task.

2. Just learn SQL it's easy

Yeah, It looks like I'm going to need to do this, but it doesn't really answer my question.

3. People working on a team should all use the same technology for peer review, and so others can pick up where one left off if they leave, plus other reasons. (\*insert harsh sarcasm implying I want everyont on a potential team to switch from SQL to Spark\*)

I come from a collaborative team of scientists who use a variety of tech, from my perspective it seemed reasonable to have a team where not everyone uses the same technology. I guess this is more of a unique case than I was aware of and most companies only hire people who can use the same tech as the team they would be working on. This makes sense to me, I just didn't think it was as obvious/required as others are suggessting.

(If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=think+python&amp;qid=1586982845&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&amp;sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&amp;#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Mathematical Proof That No Decision-making Algorithm Can Be Completely Fair,Discussion,"I few months ago, when listening to a data science podcast, I came across a notion that there have been papers published demonstrating a mathematical paradox related to algorithmic fairness. The gist was that there a three characteristics that we would ideally like a decision-making algorithm to embody, yet it can be proven mathematically that these can't be simultaneously satisfied—there is always a trade-off. I believe that two of these characteristics were false-positive and false-negative rate but I'm not even sure of that. Is there anyone familiar with this topic that could point me towards the paper?

Is BERT too general for an NLP project with a very limited corpus with very specific contexts?,Discussion,"I am working as a Machine Learning dev on an NLP project in the Aerospace industry. To give professional context, prior to this most of my ML work so far has been with structured numerical, ordinal, or categorical data from 3D simulations &amp; video games and NLP is somewhat new to me. 

Specifically the goal is the following

1. Users take a picture of standardized work specifications with a custom app on their phones and then an OCR technology recognizes the text in the picture. (The OCR tech is already working)
2. A custom NLP tech classifies the text in the picture into specific classes and then populates a form in the app with the recognized text.

I am working on the NLP side and trying to decide which word embedding to use. The corpus for this project have meanings that are very specific to an Aerospace context (for example ""ceiling"" would relate to almost exclusively to the maximum altitude of an aircraft and NOT walls/floor/etc. ) and the amount of unique words on the work orders is likely no more than 2500-4000.

BERT's bidirectional approach seems like it would lead in general to accurate understanding of context, but I'm wondering if the pre-trained BERT models would be far too general an application like this where the context is ultra-specific.

My questions specifically are

1. Would a pre-trained BERT model be likely to overgeneralize here? 
2. Would training a BERT model from scratch (likely to do NER) be overkill? Would a simpler model be better here?",57,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g1suaz/is_bert_too_general_for_an_nlp_project_with_a/,22,datascience,working machine learning dev nlp project aerospace industry give professional context prior ml work far structured numerical ordinal categorical data simulation amp video game nlp somewhat new specifically goal following user take picture standardized work specification custom app phone ocr technology recognizes text picture ocr tech already working custom nlp tech classifies text picture specific class populates form app recognized text working nlp side trying decide word embedding use corpus project meaning specific aerospace context example ceiling would relate almost exclusively maximum altitude aircraft wall floor etc amount unique word work order likely bert bidirectional approach seems like would lead general accurate understanding context wondering pre trained bert model would far general application like context ultra specific question specifically would pre trained bert model likely overgeneralize would training bert model scratch likely ner overkill would simpler model better,bert general nlp project limited corpus specific context
How to get real meaning from clustering analysis?,Discussion,"Hi folks,

I've been looking at Clustering with Kmeans in SciKit Learn. I've produced a workbook and got everything to work with a pretty graph and decent metrics.

My dataset has 8 features, which I reduced to 3D in order to make the analysis work. However, that leaves me with a 3D scatter plot that looks nice but I can't relate it back to the 8 features I started with.

FAANG Data Scientist -&gt; Software Engineer?,Career,"I'm currently a data scientist at a big tech company, about 2 years in after a career change in my mid 20s. My current job is about as close to my dream job as it gets. I work on interesting problems and I genuinely enjoy the work. I'm concerned about my career path and am considering switching to software engineer for a few reasons:

1. I only have a bachelor's degree. It's a **solid** bachelors degree (computer science and stats from an ivy), but a bachelor nonetheless. Literally every data science manager i can think of has at least a master's. I'm confident that I *could* make progress at my current company, but at places like google they won't even hire a data scientist without a masters. I'm paying down lots of student debt right now and couldn't dream of going another 100k in the hole. From what I can tell, software engineering doesn't have this hard education cutoff.
2. I write next to no production code. I crank out analyses using jupyter notebooks and SQL like my hair is on fire, but only my final recommendations are seen. Combining this with a recent influx of MBAs into the field, I worry that I'm on track to a not-so-technical career path. Like consultant or something. Not necessarily bad, but I fell in love with writing code before I was a data scientist.
3. The big advances in analytics seem to be coming from building platforms, services, etc. I think I'm naturally inclined to build things and I enjoy this kind of work. Down the road, the combination of these two kinds of data science (business-focus and engineering-focused ) would give me a huge leg up.

Should I make the jump? I'm in my early 30s and I'm just not jazzed about dropping a mortgage down payment for another degree just for the ability to advance. I'd rather leverage what I've learned as a data scientist as a leg up on a career path that doesn't have the same barrier to entry.

[DS Topic of the Week] Should Data Science Managers/Leads have a Data Science background?,Discussion,"Welcome to the **DS Topic of the Week**!  

This week's topic is **Should Data Science Managers/Leads have a Data Science background?**

&gt;While data science practitioners can come from diverse set of technical backgrounds, the people who manage teams of data scientists can come from both technical and non-technical backgrounds.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you feel that having a technical background is important for these managers?  Alternatively, do overly technical managers tend to lack the non-technical soft skills to being an effective manager?  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the choice, what kind of background would you want your next manager to have?  Does the size and composition of the team make a difference?

# Intuition

Once upon a time, there was a task given (this was a decade back when excel &amp; vlookup were the 2 of 3 famous terms in the world of analytics).  
As the story goes… this was for a retail industry, we did some analytics around the products that customers are purchasing. 1. What are the products they are looking at &amp; searching? 2. What are the commonalities, pattern, segmentation etc etc.  
End of the day, we had to analyse hundreds of thousands of transactions; thousands of people, their purchase and invoices;

We found an interesting pattern happening very often. When people shop in the evening between 6 and 9. **Customers who buy diapers also buy beer**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syeee0ym4rs41.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80befea480ce0ec2391ebfdbed336a776433e30b

But, this insight was like out of the blue completely as these 2 products are completely not connected.  
***Why would somebody buy beer when they’re buying diapers or why buy diapers when they’re buying beer!!!***  
So that was the fact we came across in the data and the explanations as fact. **One of the plausible explanations we gave;** In the evenings, when the husband gets home and when they take care of their baby; they sometimes find that they run out of diapers and who has to go pick up the diapers.. well, the husband. The wife sends husband to go pick up the diapers and **while he is picking up the diapers because its already after work hours, he also picks up some beer. Right.**

And this plausible explanation might be logical or not be. This is something you can’t really think of it just by yourself but that comes from the data.

As I’ve highlighted this in my previous [***post***](https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&amp;sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7), based on certain insights derived from data; a supermarket or retail industry can decide how to arrange products in your shelf **whether you run an e-commerce store to rank &amp; show your products in your virtual shelf or a superstore to put these 2 products to entice people while shopping.**

So there is a lot of interesting marketing tactics that are using based on this data. But the question is; how do you get to this data?

**And one of the ways to get to it is leveraging analytics use apriori algorithm.**

# Problem Statement

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on one’s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:  
*Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.*  
*Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.*  
*Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.*  
*X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.*

Association rules are “if-then rules” with two measures which quantify the support and confidence of the rule for a given data set. Having their origin in market basket analysis, association rules are now one of the most popular tools in data mining. This popularity is to a large part due to the availability of efficient algorithms. The first and arguably most influential algorithm for efficient association rule discovery is Apriori.

**Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.**  
Folks from healthcare industry, are you reading this ?

# Definition

Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. There are three common ways to measure association.

1. **Support:**  
This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **2. Confidence:**  
This will highlight how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -&gt; Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In diagram below, the confidence of {apple -&gt; beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3h2hccty4rs41.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d295d99297f9b7e0f21c17062d3c4b53a1f63e43

**3. Lift:**  
Table below how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In diagram below, the lift of {apple -&gt; beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ko7fjsg35rs41.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50b3cdf0cb7497a5043dcbe689c40a61c0096db6

**Association Rule Mining**  
Now that we understand how to quantify the importance of association of products within an itemset, the next step is to generate rules from the entire list of items and identify the most important ones. This is not as simple as it might sound. Supermarkets will have hundred of thousands of different products in store. After some simple calculations, it can be shown that just 10 products will lead to 57000 rules!! And this number increases exponentially with the increase in number of items.  
Finding lift values for each of these will get computationally very very expensive. How to deal with this problem? How to come up with a set of most important association rules to be considered? Apriori algorithm comes to our rescue for this.

**Lets build an efficient recommendation system in R studio**

1. Load data
2. Install apriori
3. Data pre-processing | Decode sparse matrix | Plot
4. Train &amp; Test
5. Visualize

In this example, we will work on a sample dataset from a grocery store, understand the business problem, and ways to optimize the sales using apriori algorithm leveraging machine learning.

Uncomfortable as data scientist: looking for guidance,Discussion,"This may not be a super structured post, but I just want to get something off my chest: I'm 24 years old, and around 6 months ago I joined as a data scientist at a consulting firm (for people who care, MBB) and I am extremely uncomfortable in my position. I simply feel like I don't know enough, and that I never will.. At the same time, I find the work very rewarding and technically interesting, and I definitely want to stay in the field. This leads to the realization that if I am to stay in the field, I should find ways to deal with this discomfort. Maybe you guys can help me..

I have a background in aerospace engineering, and got into the field by basically doing self study (understanding the math behind most basic algorithms, applying them to Kaggle problems, and getting as good as possible in Python). I interned as a data scientist where I basically did nothing academic (sort of a real-life Kaggle competition to be honest), and through some luck ended up in the position I am in now.

Fueled by imposter syndrome, I tend to spend most of my free time (weekends mainly) doing self study and trying to learn more. I am not doing this because I **have** to, I am genuinely interested in the field. However, it feels like there is so much to learn and it is starting to get to me.

To give some context, I have never done anything related to neural networks. I kind of know how it works on a high level and I know what backpropagation is and the math behind it, but I have never actually coded up any sort of deep learning model. I am definitely not comfortable in using it in my daily work.

I also don't know anything about Bayesian statistics. I have spent the last week or so going through numerous sources and am now comfortable with the idea of priors, likelihood functions, how to update the posterior, and various ways of finding the posterior (grid approximation/quadrature/MCMC). But again, I have never actually used it so I don't feel like I actually am capable of using it in my day-to-day work.

Just today I learned about the existence of Generalized Linear Models, and it is as if suddenly I am confronted with yet another beast which I had no idea existed. But guess what: if I truly want to be a good at what I do and be a master in my field, I have to learn this as well. And at this point, I don't even really know what it means.

I guess my general question is: how do you guys deal with this situation? There are seemingly infinite things to learn about, and then each of those things can be learned to an arbitrary level of detail. How do you pick what to learn/focus on, and how do you decide that ""enough is enough?"".

Also, how do you decide if something you learned off-the-job is useful in your daily work?

"Been perpetually baffled ever since stepping into the field as to why Matplotlib is considered a staple for DS in Python, beyond very basic EDA. Matplotlib experts - do help shed some light!",Discussion,"While I've found myself using Python *extensively* for all kinds of Data Cleaning, machine learning, and a number of other more software engineering-related things, visualization is one thing I find myself resorting to much easier options for. 

Beyond very elementary data visualization during EDA stages that serves just to paint a clearer picture in my mind of what a physical representation of my data might look like, I'm pretty stumped as to what more matplotlib offers. Does it really bring something to the table that not only makes it worth the trouble of trying to learn it properly despite its unintuitive rules, but also makes it superior to other options that are plain easier and less time consuming?

I'm not dense enough to think that people who take the time to get extremely good at it don't have their reasons - I'm just really eager to learn what those are. Just came out of a stackoverflow exchange thinking ""how on EARTH could that dude have known precisely that"", so now left curious as to what the motivating factor is for matplotlib virtuosos.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g0ijxj/been_perpetually_baffled_ever_since_stepping_into/,16,datascience,found using python extensively kind data cleaning machine learning number software engineering related thing visualization one thing find resorting much easier option beyond elementary data visualization eda stage serf paint clearer picture mind physical representation data might look like pretty stumped matplotlib offer really bring something table make worth trouble trying learn properly despite unintuitive rule also make superior option plain easier le time consuming dense enough think people take time get extremely good reason really eager learn came stackoverflow exchange thinking earth could dude known precisely left curious motivating factor matplotlib virtuoso,perpetually baffled ever since stepping field matplotlib considered staple d python beyond basic eda matplotlib expert help shed light
My Giant Data Quality Checklist,Projects,"First - [I also published this on Medium if you'd prefer to read the full article there](https://medium.com/@TWB_BI/starting-a-data-quality-checklist-2d500e97ab5c),

Here's the list without all the intro BS. Please do comment if you have some items to add! :

# Chapter 1 : General Structure

* Is there an established map of the database?
* Is it visible to all users?
* Is there a public strategy of how it is tested for truth?
* Are there known party(ies) responsible for updating it when there are structural changes?
* How often is it updated?
* When is the next scheduled update?
* Is there a change log to track prior changes?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with questions?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with general conversational topics?
* The user list from a DBA is great for this.
* Consider having a monthly meeting and yearly summit per database. Remember, this is YOUR responsibility. Not the owner of the database.
* If the source of data is an application or form, is there a map from every entry field to the corresponding field in the database?
* Capacity / Uptime
* How concerned should you be with locking up the database with poorly written queries?
* Who do you go to when it is dead?
* Is the data backed up / archived anywhere?
* For how long?
* Do you remove old values from the production database after archiving?
* Are queries logged?
* How often is the database refreshed, if it is part of an ETL?
* Automatically check, at the appropriate time, if it has been updated. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably not updated.
* What is the official way to request access to the database?
* Is there a time-out process of old user ID’s?
* Have a plan in place for when an automated procedure’s stored credentials are suddenly invalid.

**Tables**

* Is there any rhyme or reason to the naming of tables?
* If there are very similar tables (ie. CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER\_NEW, CUSTOMER\_NEW\_NEW), do the alternates need to exist?
* Is this table “one row that is constantly kept updated” or “one row for each time the data changes”?

**Joins**

* Should there be at least one “Child” for every “Parent”?
* Is there a maximum expected “Children” for every “Parent”?
* Should there be “Children” who don’t have “Parents”?
* Is every table relatable to every other table?
* On joining fields
* Do the field types match, or do you need to do a conversion?
* Queries / Processes
* Is the query properly notated?
* With the code removed, the notes should be copy and paste-able to a non-technical business partner.
* The notes should represent reality. Please.
* Is it possible to do an “anti-query”?
* Reverse your filters, but mirror your production process. In high value pipelines, this can be a huge preventative measure for errors, and an easy way to provide “free” extra value.
* Is it possible to do the query by hand on a small subset of records?
* If so, do this periodically. Seriously. I know you got into this line of business to not do this stuff manually, but doing this periodically can help verify all systems are working properly.
* Is the process entirely automated?
* If not, don’t launch.
* This includes any of the tests below that say “periodically”, if possible.
* Is it possible to store the results of every query, along with a timestamp of run (especially as part of an ETL process?)
* Are you choosing a “whitelist” approach, or a “blacklist” approach?
* If there are changes after launch — will you be applying those changes to previous projects, or leaving them in place with old (and potentially inaccurate) data?

# Chapter 2 : Data Types

**All / General**

* Are null values allowed?
* Are the fields expected to change over time? If the answer is “no”, take hashes of lines at the time of development and test periodically to see if they change. If the answer is “yes”, take extracts with timestamps in the name and only use those (instead of production) for reproducibility.
* Expert level — Create a X / Y grid of every field against every other field. Have all parties involved in development (especially the humans that are the source of the data) write assumptions and rules that come up in each cell (if this field is “beer” this other field should be “$5.99”) Document all of these. If something looks wrong and the customer says “that’s ok”, DOCUMENT THIS. With audio evidence if possible. Video isn’t bad either.

**General Text (Free entry)**

* If there is a default size, why is the default size set to the size it is?
* Is the field having an identity crisis — does it only contain integers, dates, locations, etc.? If so — should it be converted to the correct type? What do you do with those that can’t be converted?
* Does the text contain invisible characters that will cause it to print strangely (line-break)?
* Does the text contain special (or international) characters? Should it? If you are planning on exporting to .csv downstream, are you removing commas upstream (or tabs, or pipes, etc.).
* Is there a list of “stop words” that should be applied? Especially inappropriate words. Don’t let an f-bomb get into a shareholder report.

**Categorical Text (Unique list of values)**

* Store the unique values at the time you are developing, and the counts of each value. Periodically test for new/missing values. Have a plan in place for when this inevitably happens.
* Periodically test for wild changes in distribution. Communicate these to anyone who will listen. This will make you a hero. Provide this list to stakeholders during development. This is always interesting, because often it is vastly different than their estimate.
* If there are multiple categorical fields, is there an hierarchy that is documented and should be followed (if veh\_type is “car”, then veh\_brand can only be “audi”, “ford”, “toyota” etc.). Have a plan in place for when this inevitably breaks.
* Is the field indexed for fast grouping?
* If the values are text numbers (one, two, three) — should they be converted to integers (1, 2, 3)?

**Boolean (True/False)**

* If these represent a “switch” in the process, should the downstream impact also be represented in data? (if override\_price=0 then discount\_price should never be null)
* Store the distribution at the time of developing, and periodically test for changes. Communicate these to anyone who will listen.
* Does True or False have a different name to you customers? IE, 0 = No Sale, 1 = Sale.
* What should you do with nulls, if there are any?

**ID (Keys, AutoNum)**

* Is the ID an AutoNum? If so, are there missing values?
* Is the ID a complex key? Do characters in the complex key relate to the data in any way? Periodically test that this remains true.
* Are duplicates allowed?
* Are you operating under the assumption that the ID for any given record will never change (maintaining an extract or join to a private table)? Have a plan in place for when they inevitably do.
* If you remove the ID from the equation, are there any two completely identical rows?

**General Number/Integer**

* Does null = 0?
* Are negative values expected?
* Are decimals expected? If not, is there rounding occurring upstream? What are the rounding rules?
* Is there a maximum/minimum expected value? Record the minimum and maximum value at the time of development. Periodically test to see if this record has been broken.
* Is there an expected distribution? Periodically test to see if this has changed.
* Is the number secretly categorical (only certain allowed values)?
* Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250…)?
* Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?
* Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I’m looking at you, Smallint)?
* Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price\*tax=total)?
* Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?

**Currency**

* Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?
* If the record also has a “country” — does the currency match the country?
* Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.
* Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.
* Does null = 0?
* Does the value represent a “current” value, or a “point in time” value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?
* Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?

**General Contact Information**

* Is there a schedule for updating contact information?
* When was the information last updated?
* When was the information last successfully used?
* If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.
* Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?
* Does any contact information match your own company/office information?
* Does any customer’s information match that of a current or former employee?
* Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!

**Phone Numbers**

* Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?
* Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.
* Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?
* Is there an assumed area code?
* Is the area code a toll free area code?
* Is the area code a legitimate area code?
* Is the phone number stored as text?
* Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?
* Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?
* Are you removing “bogus” phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).
* If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?

**Mailing Address**

* Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?
* Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?
* If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?
* Is the Postal Code -&gt; State/Region -&gt; Country strictly enforced?
* Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?
* Is there an additional “APT” or “PO BOX” field? Should you be aware of this?
* If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?

**Sensitive PII**

* Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?
* Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?

**Financial Information**

* God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.
* Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?
* See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.

**Date / Time**

* Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?
* Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?
* Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.
* Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.
* Are there records outside business hours?
* Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?
* Are there any dates that are in the future?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?
* When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently — it’s valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.
* If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).
* Does everyone know what “biweekly” means?
* Does everyone know what “midnight” means?
* Is there a business preferred date format?
* For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.
* Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?

How to stay organized when writing code,Tooling,"I'm using R to do an analysis of my dataset, and there's a lot of EDA and filtering in my code as I compare results of different segments.  Is there an easier way or best practice that has worked for you in terms of staying organized and making sure that as you make changes to our code and revert back, you're not forgetting or missing anything?

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

I have a 300 line code that generates some results and graphics of an overall performance.  If my boss asks me to slice my data and look at the same results and graphics at a different segment, I need to go back to line 79 to change my filter,  maybe line 120 to adjust my dataframe, etc etc to get the code working.  Lots of things can go wrong here, especially when I revert back to the original and I may forget about line 120, something like that, or if I have to do multiple segments, I dont have to scroll up and down so many times

What is actually done with the Data I collect?,Discussion,"I'm so sorry if this isn't actually allowed here, as I myself am not a data scientist in any capacity. My job however does deal with data, and I'm curious about it. Tl;dr why do companies want certain data and what do they do with it? 

My company provides retailers with pricing data collected by employees in the field. I am one of those Field Data Collectors. Basically I'm assigned several jobs at different stores throughout the week. Some jobs repeat weekly, or monthly, or quarterly. Some jobs require the collecting of certain items on a list, some requiring scanning every item in a category and collecting those prices. 

An example: every week Bullseye wants to know how Walcarts prices a specific 500 items at 20 different stores in the area. I'm assigned 3 stores, go into each of those stores and find the items, scan them, and input the prices. If that store does not carry the exact item I indicate it. Different DCs are assigned the different locations.

I don't even know what happens in my own company after I upload my job to submit the data i've collected, let alone what the retailer does with the data they're given. 

I'm just curious, why do these major retailers (and even some minor more local/ region specific retailers) contract with our company to get this data? What do they use it for? The company website sells itself as ""Our clients benefit from omni-channel, normalized, and actionable Pricing Intelligence at massive scale to inform on-target pricing strategy and maximize business impact."" What does that even mean? 

Another question I have, who benefits most from this data? Is it only the corporations, or is there any benefit to the consumer as well? 

Also, when Bullseye wants pricing from Walcarts, Walcarts sends us to a Rokger banner, and Rokger finally asks for Bullseye data, does that really end up benefiting anybody? They're all getting data from eachother in a circular manner.

Since, it is fairly late to apply for other internships and remote options are heavily applied for leading to low likelihood of securing one, I am worried about the whole situation.

So my question to current Data Scientists is how important is an internship in securing a permanent job? Are there any alternatives to that?

Also, what should I do over the summer that would be helpful towards advancing my career in Data Science?

Unique R Packages for Data Science,Tooling,"Hey all, I’m looking to begin writing a notebook for my team (data science), where I keep track of “unique” R packages and what they can be used for in the DS realm. An example I can think of off the top of my head would be something like “Plotluck”. It’s not your typical package that most people know about, and it seems to be pretty cool from a higher glance at it.

So my question - Which R packages different from the norm do you advocate for? What do they do that makes you such a big fan of them?

Turned down Uber's Data Scientist final job interview...did I make a mistake?,Career,"Data Scientist in Silicon Valley here. Started applying for jobs 2 months ago to transition to a new company before the pandemic hit. I interviewed with multiple companies and reached the final interview portion for Uber before bailing on it (as well as all other companies in my pipeline). I increasingly felt that these service app companies were especially volatile and vulnerable right now, if you see what's going on with their stocks, their non-existent customer base, and mass layoffs (ex: Thumbtack).

But did I make a mistake in my assessment? I don't know if I overly freaked out and turned down what would likely have become a job offer. My company pays me well, and since I'm in the online streaming business it feels a lot more secure.

Books on Data Science/Machine Learning impact,Discussion,"I am a data scientist/ML engineer trying to get to know different  angles for looking at my profession, especially how it may affect people  with other background.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased  (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some  point)

* *Master Algorithm* by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis)
* *Weapons of Math Destruction* by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points. I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left
* *Outnumbered* by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not. Also he doesn't push any ML hype, and actually finds there is no proof for some results that got huge media coverage.
* *Architects of Intelligence* \- it's a set of interviews with ML people. What is great about it is that you can see that there is no consensus on the future of the field, and that people who actually have impact have divergent opinions on some topics (like for example on regulation)
* *AI Superpowers* by Kai-Fu Lee - a book by author who was involved with many facets of ML - research, business side (as head of Google China) and venture capital. This one is especially interesting since aside from AI it describes digitalization in China. One of maiin theses is that the US leads in research, but implementation side is tilted towards China because of different business culture (author says that in China companies are not so innovative, as everyone copies from one another another, but that makes its environment more competitive since it doesn't have so strong founder effect where first company to come up with an idea dominates its niche).

How to avoid procrastination at home,Education,"You are probably working at home remotely. At home, you may find many distractions: mobile notifications, social media notifications, kids around, the TV turned on or phone ringing constantly.

These things are keeping you away from getting things done. Now you have enough free time to work on that project, to widen your in Data Science, to implement this new tool at your job, to do that course or to become an expert in your field. Here are 3 quick tips that will increase your focus and will make you avoid distractions:

- Set up a clean environment. Have your desk clear. If possible be alone in the room, where no one in your family will be passing by. Set boundaries with them, telling them that you will be working so please no interruptions if it is not needed. 

- Follow your normal routine at your job. Take breaks, do the pauses you normally do and when finishing your job totally disconnect from work. Avoid reading and responding to emails in the evening.  

- Set clear goals. The uncertainty makes us work with no direction. Create specific and objective goals, give them a time frame and start each day with the task which needs a bigger effort from you.

A coworker is taking this bootcamp [https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online), but it seems somewhat introductory?

I am comfortable working with Python, R, SQL. I think I'm a pretty good coder, but I would like to learn more and get better. I really enjoy coding!  I know enough Javascript and HTML to do my job (interactive dashboards using D3js). I'm familiar with ML and have done projects, but I'm not super comfortable. Also, I learned all the math and stats in college, but I haven't done much data analysis in the real world yet so it would be nice to practice those skills. Also never learned any big data stuff, so maybe it's time to learn Hadoop? Not sure.

Has anyone done any bootcamps that they can recommend that are for fine tuning these data science skills that you already have and learning more complex things?

Dealing with Unrealistic Expectations as Employee #2,Discussion,"Wondering if anyone can help me out in my current situation

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr** the company that just hired me is not ready for data scientists. I’m being asked to do things that are very far from my expertise, but I also have no other job prospects. I also really like the field the app is in, have a ton of time while under quarantine, and the motivation to try and make as much of this work as possible. Any help is appreciated.

\----

I’m a data science bootcamp graduate (I know, I know. I apologize for existing.) and not surprisingly have been struggling to find my entry into the field, but I was getting interviews, particularly in my area/domain of interest. Then the virus hit the US and all my prospects shriveled, except for one. It’s a startup in my domain, an app where users would make decisions regarding a particular “score”.

&amp;#x200B;

Originally, we had discussed integrating with his development team (working with them on an initial model of the aforementioned “score”) - then, as the initial model is productionalized, I would switch to data-driven content creation (data viz, dashboards, articles and presentations for non-tech users) to help in communicating technical aspects the product internally, and marketing the product externally, an area of the field I enjoy. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we negotiated equity, and I sign-on, and it turns out I’m the first (and only) full-time employee. The development team is all freelance. The company has no data engineers, so the founder has asked me for guidance on setting up historical data from an API on our own servers. The extent of my data engineering knowledge is: I’ve used SQL to connect to preexisting architectures, and I’ve seen people use Spark/Hive/Hadoop. I’m researching Apache Airflow like a madman, but (obviously) in way over my head.

&amp;#x200B;

He also wants me to spearhead the marketing campaign. There is no website. There is no chosen domain. But I’ve had dozens of pages of “marketing book notes” delivered to me, and I’m supposed to turn it into some kind of plan for my own content, then execute said plan. He wants me to be the lead on creating strategic partnerships within the industry. While I love ""making things"" (I'm also a YT/podcast content creator for fun), I’m not a marketer at whatsoever and don't have some big list of in-industry contacts, so... I’m just completely in the dark there.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a ton of people would just peace out and look for another job, but since I've got no other options at the moment: for those who have been in similar situations and stuck it out: who’ve dealt with a founder/boss with unrealistic expectations re: what one entry-level data scientist can do, I’d love to hear how you went about A) your work (what tools/resources) you saught-out and B) how you handled communicating unrealistic expectations while still doing your level-best to rise to the occasion.

What hiring managers are really looking for,Career,"I’ve been following this sub for awhile, and am currently in the middle of a few hiring processes for data analysts/ scientists. I work for a midsized SaaS company as an embedded and thought I’d share what we are really looking for! 
* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the “whole board” they’re seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you’ve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren’t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**EDIT TO ADD:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven’t developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You’d be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. “Tell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem”. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* Re: starting my own business and my skill level - obviously I’m not 100% at all of these things. No one is! We all have areas to grow. Also, I don’t want to work on my own.

* Per a comment, I cleaned up my formatting :)

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok. Lean on what you're good at, have an attitude that focuses on continuous learning, and be a strong team player.",509,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fvgx3n/what_hiring_managers_are_really_looking_for/,113,datascience,following sub awhile currently middle hiring process data analyst scientist work midsized saas company embedded thought share really looking sql reason huge hole d data cleaning manipulation know syntax know manipulate raw product table get data want able defend pull business line owner stakeholder ask showing showing logic self deduction skill talking math like logic includes business interpersonal logic well example person asking whole board seeing ability check data finding product output business situation know pulled right finding make sense number hold water someone know product data inter working inside non technical stakeholder communication skill includes presentation building rapport relationship managing managing different attitude understanding perspective understanding ask question listen line building strong daily partnership business strategy skill completed project mean business see whole board make recommendation fit grit attitude aka ability wrangle messy problem messy data messy relationship politics know get mess self problem solve call favor also willingness grunt work like write sql figure product data produced wtf engineer thinking structured product way politicking relationship building understand work product biz line owner exec etc solve problem strong willingness help others tableau data viz way able clearly relay finding like attitude people comfortable even basic bar chart graph able look graph glance consume telling python r special package math modeling etc see many people worried x language package actually think relatively easy learn soft skill taught school important hardest find honestly analyst data scientist get cool stuff time lot boring stuff easy technically built dashboard day took maybe hour start coding finish people falling excitement fancy made easy get needed quickly hiring manager think edit add else equal hire based culture team fit willingness learn attitude fit often outweigh technical skill requisite mastery level certainly depend job level junior level candidate understand developed yet attitude think know everything bc hard skill recognize starting soft skill need learn surprised many people graduate m phd work experience think deserve senior level role sorry drop ego know little bit actually need know successful convey interview resume ask interview question ask performance based question tell time partnered non technical stakeholder solve business problem talk solved business problem first tool used get like hearing cool stuff also need know basic stuff soft skill really well starting business skill level obviously thing one area grow also want work per comment cleaned formatting hire well rounded team everyone different background everyone going know everything ok lean good attitude focus continuous learning strong team player,hiring manager really looking

htmlcreator: build standalone HTML documents from Python,Tooling,"I often find myself in need to share my findings (mainly tables and pictures) with collaborators. When I started working in Data Science I was using Jupyter Notebook a lot, so I usually exported .ipynb to .html and voilà. But over years I switched completely from notebooks to scripts (even though I love new Jupyter Lab). Without notebooks, creating standalone HTML file with images and tables wasn't easy anymore. I couldn't find simple Python package to help me with that, so I created my own one: [htmlcreator](https://pypi.org/project/htmlcreator).

It exposes simple API for creating standalone HTML files from Python code containing text, images and tables embedded inside. It has also default styling (CSS), so everything looks nicer. I've been using it for around 2 years now and recently decided to publish it, so others can use it too.

see [examples/1_build_first_document.py](https://github.com/ar-nowaczynski/htmlcreator/blob/master/examples/1_build_first_document.py) and its output: [examples/1_first_document.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ar-nowaczynski/htmlcreator/blob/master/examples/1_first_document.html)

Text classification service API or docker image recommendations,Discussion,"I have a website that organizes factual claims and allows the community to rate them based on objective qualities.  One current feature associated with each claim is called ""topics"".  I'm considering a redesign where topics are calculated automatically based on the contents of the claim, its sources, and its evidence provided.

Technology is no bother for me, as I built the website from the ground up.  However, I know next to nothing about data science.  I've spent most of today researching where I even need to begin.

What I think I'm looking for is called Text Classification.  Here's what I imagine my process would look like.

1. Certain users sometimes enter topics with each claim.  When they do, the back-end will take that opportunity to train a model with the user provided topics.  Maybe I have to spend some time training the model myself, which is fine.  Who trains it doesn't matter, but I would like the model to be trained against a specific set of topics.  This could eventually be in the thousands.
2. Certain users take advantage of auto-tagging of topics, and the claim document is then submitted to the text classification service by the back-end where it will predict one to many topics automatically.
3. Depending on other services provided by the text classification solution, it may also be used for fuzzy searching and trending topics.

Here's where I'm uncertain:

1. Am I on the right track with text classification as the right solution to this problem?  I've seen several tools for ""text annotation"" but those seem more interactive, and tied to recognizing existing named entities, whereas I want to train the model against a more tailored lexicon (train a document against a topic/category/label/whatever).
2. Most examples I saw while researching only used one topic to train one document, and got only one topic in return when predicting a document.  I am looking for a solution where I can provide many topics per doc in training, and get many topics back when predicting.
3. Does training end, or is it continuous?  Is there such a thing as over-training?  I'd also need to factor in storage size for trained topics, especially if it is continuous.
4. Can text classification be used to determine topics that are trending and fading?  Or, is that a different data science approach/solution?
5. I think I found what I need in GCP [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) Natural Languare Processing API, but it is too expensive ($5 per 1000 doc predictions!?).
6. And, assuming I'm on the right track with all of this, does anyone know of any production-ready service API's or docker images out there, or even libraries I could integrate with or build a service around?  I'm technology agnostic and am comfortable in many languages including python.  But, most everything I've found seems one-off, white-paper-ish, experimental, small-scale (i.e. in-memory only), etc...  Here are the ones that seemed closest to what I want to do:
   1. [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) \- node toolsuite with most everything I think I need, but would need to build up persistence storage and run benchmarking to assess its scalability.
   2. [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy) \- Seems more UI human interaction focused, rather than API driven.  And, not sure about custom lexicon given the emphasis on general annotation.
   3. [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) \- Same comments as [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy), but  got excited when I saw they had a docker image. Didn't seem like the right solution for my problem, though.
   4. [cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/) \- AWS based, service based, but wasn't clear on how they offer text classification at all.  I wondered if I could makeshift their sentiment analysis just using a custom  topics.  I could work with AWS, but it's not my first choice
   5. [monkeylearn.com](https://monkeylearn.com) and various other services that aren't upfront about pricing or are just too expensive.
   6. [xgboost.readthedocs.io](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) \- here's one that I believe is production ready and \*probably\*, but I have a hard time figuring out what the heck it does or what I do with it!
   7. [klassify](https://github.com/fatiherikli/klassify) \- This one seemed the most straightforward, and closest to what I'm trying to do, has a docker image, works with redis, and so it seems scalable.  But, I wasn't sure if anyone had any experience with it or if it meets my requirement of pulling multiple topics out of one document (at first glance it only seems to work with one).

Appreciate any help on the matter!  I have a [sandbox](https://sandbox.thinkards.org) up if that helps gauge what the website abilities are.  I'm aware the UI/UX needs some work, and I am working on it (that's at least two things I'm clueless on)!

"Looking for an online, part-time MEATY DS/ML graduate program",Education,"I am a data analyst who is looking at getting a MS in Data Science/Machine Learning, and I'm running into the issue that a lot of the online programs are pretty light--very weak on math and theory and clearly oriented towards making a quick buck in the Hot New Field Of Data Science.

So far the closest I've seen to what I want is the [JHU part-time online data science master's](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/data-science), but they have the weird requirement of C++ as a pre-req (at least it seems weird to me).

Any dyslectic or dyscalculia data scientist?,Education,"Hello data science subreddit, 

I have a question. I'm thinking about doing a minor in data science and later on maby a master. I'm doing a bachelor in marketing, and right now I'm doing an internship in marketing insights (research). I have really taken an interest in data and statistics and also data science. I would love to learn more about it but there is one thing holding me back.

 I am dyslectic and I have discalculia, both diagnosed at a very young age. There both not as severe now that I'm older. Mainly I'm bad at spelling and mental arithmetics. But I will also  misread numbers or letters or remember them wrong fairly often. So this might lead to small errors here and there.

On my current internship it's not a super big deal because we always look over everyone's work before sending it out anyway. 

But I guess my question is to anyone reading, is it a stupid idea to get into data science with these learning disabilities because I'm probably more prone to making errors? 
If there is anyone working (or studying) in data science who is dyslectic or has discalculia I would love to hear about your experience.
Don't be afraid to give me an honest answer, I want to know.

2. Asking for an extensive amount of coding and work far beyond 10 hours.  like if you want to have a complex coding problem with large data files with tons of issues, its kind of bullshit to ask for a powerpoint on top of it

- Statistics: Still using out of college knowledge, can get more developed at abstraction, intuition, and baking in more stats in my general intuition (that comes with time and practice but I feel I can learn more on this end)   

- Cloud Dev (aka) MLOps: I've been some work on that end, seems very interesting to me as I come from an engineering background


B. Pick up a completely new skill: Deep Learning: 
I know just enough from school to say I trained a Neural Network, I'm not familiar with the details, the Keras/PyTorch feud nor advanced hyperparameter tunning. Either I can invest in the famous Coursera DL bundle, or Udacity or whichever fits.

Seeking Feedback on Data Science Workflow Tool,Tooling,"I'm excited (and nervous) to share a product I've been working on for the past few months to get feedback from this community. While I'm more of a *heavy* lurker, /r/datascience has always been an excellent source of discovery and insights for Data Scientists both new and experienced.

I've seen a lot of frustrations when it comes to making Data Science effective in an organization. Issues like:

- Complicated tooling and configurations
- Lack of pipeline and data testing
- Lack of visibility into projects as they start to expand in complexity
- Being forced to wear hats for every step of the end-to-end data cycle
- Different data teams operating in silos
- Lack of access to required cloud resources
- Projects rarely making it to production

All of these issues make it difficult for a Data Science team to drive value and build trust. But I don't think it should have to be that way.

With these frustrations in mind, I set out to build a workflow platform - [Shipyard](https://www.shipyardapp.com) - that helps eliminate the friction of getting solutions to production so Data Scientists can focus more on Data, not DevOps.

To be brief, we've designed the platform to:

- Launch solutions with no DevOps or complicated setups involved. We're cloud-native and handle all scaling on your behalf.
- Orchestrate solutions across teams to create complex pipelines with no edits or additions to your code.
- Monitor and alert on the status of hundreds of solutions for peace of mind.
- Share custom, repeatable solutions with the larger organization using Blueprints.

We're still in the early stages, so I'm looking for anyone that might be interested in testing us out and providing feedback. It's 100% free right now in exchange for your feedback. If you're interested, let me know.

Either way, I'd love to hear the tools currently being used to manage workflows/pipelines and any problems you may be facing with them right now.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fsif1v/seeking_feedback_on_data_science_workflow_tool/,3,datascience,excited nervous share product working past month get feedback community heavy lurker r datascience always excellent source discovery insight data scientist new experienced seen lot frustration come making data science effective organization issue like complicated tooling configuration lack pipeline data testing lack visibility project start expand complexity forced wear hat every step end end data cycle different data team operating silo lack access required cloud resource project rarely making production issue make difficult data science team drive value build trust think way frustration mind set build workflow platform shipyard http www shipyardapp com help eliminate friction getting solution production data scientist focus data devops brief designed platform launch solution devops complicated setup involved cloud native handle scaling behalf orchestrate solution across team create complex pipeline edits addition code monitor alert status hundred solution peace mind share custom repeatable solution larger organization using blueprint still early stage looking anyone might interested testing u providing feedback free right exchange feedback interested let know either way love hear tool currently used manage workflow pipeline problem may facing right,seeking feedback data science workflow tool

Estimating Covid-19 Infections based on Reported Deaths,Projects,"Since the number of test varies significantly between individual countries, and no country is is even close to reaching 100% test coverage, the reported infections have to be taken with a gigantic grain of salt. However, reported deaths should be much more accurate, since everybody who dies as a consequence of a covid infection pretty much has to be ""in the system"".

So I tried to find a way to ""backtrack"" actual infection numbers based on reported deaths and some other parameters. The calculation could look something like this:

**Assumptions**

* Number of infections is doubling every 3 days
* It takes on average 12 days from infection to death
* Case fatality rate is 2.5%
* There are 100 new deaths reported today

**Calclulation**

* We know, that the people who died today have been infected about 12 days ago. Since 2.5% of infected people die, we can now calculate the number of people who were newly infected 12 days ago with n=100/0.025 = 4000
* We know, that the number of infections doubles every 3 days. Therefore, the number of newly infected people today has to equate, all things being equal, 2^((12 / 3)) = 16 times the amount of 12 days ago. Thus, we can assume that, today 16\*4000=64000 people will be infected
* We can run this calculation for every date, resulting in a timeseries of (new)infections
* We can take the cumulative sum of that timeseries to retrieve the final timeseries of cumulative total estimated infections

&amp;#x200B;

I created a little tool using streamlit to visualize the timeseries and play around with the assumptions for different countries:

Thoughts on lower-than-desired metrics for production or output?,Projects,"In my sort of work/project, I was tasked to classify tweets (sentiment analysis). I did the annotation step (farmed it out actually), did the inter rater thing, tried to clean it as best as I could, used a bunch of algorithms, from naive bayes to multilingual Bert to even novel algorithms, but only got an accuracy of about 80%, very little hyperparameter tuning tho (interesting to note tho is that regardless of which method I chose, they're all  quite near that accuracy range of 80%). And tbh man I'm feeling so down about it.

I sort of know why the accuracy isn't very good. Even the annotators and myself were also having some trouble during the annotation per se because there's a lot of nuance and context in the data (and a LOT of sarcasm). Like, there are some items that could really go either way. 

Is real world data really this messy? The text I'm dealing with has so much slang, text speak, different dialects and related languages, typos, all on top of code-switching. I have nothing to base on whether it's a good enough accuracy for me to proceed with my analysis or not. I am tho gonna ask my supervisor/head on their thoughts, as I clearly lack experience.

So I know this is probably simpler than I made it out to be in my head, but it being in the moment, and again, my lack of statistical knowledge in general, I literally was stumped. 


Essentially here’s what I was given:

Upon past email marketing survey efforts to a test send group of 10,000 customers, we had a 20% response rate. We then had a control group to 1,000 customers, and had a response rate of 15% with them. 

We want to lower the control group and yet, be confident we can measure the response rate with statistical significance. What would you recommend?


So basically, I pulled stuff out my ass with things like “further personalization of the designs of these email surveys as we decrease the control group size, as well as trigger(automate) emails to send surveys out in a more timely manner” (LOL) etc etc; knowing damn well that this problem isn’t really focused on the process or design of the survey itself.

They tried giving me a hint saying that this is supposed to be conceptual and there’s no one right answer and they don’t need exact calculations or anything but more of the statistical thought process one would go through for this experiment.


The only stats I remember was like simple t-tests (one sample and independent samples) but I’m rusty in both concepts and definitely need to go back and refresh every little thing about them. Plus, wasn’t even sure if this scenario even constitutes those two tests lol. 

I was feeling so good up until then since literally all of the other interviews and questions were about SQL and they were really impressed by my queries and such. And on top of that, they said most of the day to day is SQL so I felt like this might be my first analyst position I could finally land.

But what’s done is done and as I wait for a decision, I wanted to see what thought process you guys would’ve essentially said (in simplest terms?) so that I can learn and just be able to familiarize myself with some of these terminologies for future references.

Thanks in advance for any input on the matter~

EDIT: should’ve added their response when I asked for general clarification:


“So let’s say whatever lower control group we chose, we saw that the new response rate was 10%. How do we know that that given response rate can be trusted and significant? “

“Again, don’t focus on the actual value of the new response rate. It could be 15% or 20%. We just wanted to know how you’d go about saying that this response rate was not just an anomoly but can be trusted in the sense that in the future if we wanted to use the same control group number then we can expect that same response rate?”",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fqzhwd/whats_the_simplest_way_i_shouldve_answered_this/,10,datascience,hey brief summary applied market analyst position first analyst position general essentially proving sql skill tedious interview beforehand made final interview via video woo last question final interview threw everything like statistical experience knowledge except taking one stats class early college lol know probably simpler made head moment lack statistical knowledge general literally stumped essentially given upon past email marketing survey effort test send group customer response rate control group customer response rate want lower control group yet confident measure response rate statistical significance would recommend basically pulled stuff as thing like personalization design email survey decrease control group size well trigger automate email send survey timely manner lol etc etc knowing damn well problem really focused process design survey tried giving hint saying supposed conceptual one right answer need exact calculation anything statistical thought process one would go experiment stats remember like simple test one sample independent sample rusty concept definitely need go back refresh every little thing plus even sure scenario even constitutes two test lol feeling good since literally interview question sql really impressed query top said day day sql felt like might first analyst position could finally land done done wait decision wanted see thought process guy would essentially said simplest term learn able familiarize terminology future reference thanks advance input matter edit added response asked general clarification let say whatever lower control group chose saw new response rate know given response rate trusted significant focus actual value new response rate could wanted know go saying response rate anomoly trusted sense future wanted use control group number expect response rate,simplest way answered conceptual statistic methodology question interview market analyst

"People who prefer R over python, what's your rationale?",Discussion,"I've been using python for \~3-4 years now.

I'm curious what things are so easy in R, you'd never consider doing it in python? Tasks R is better suited for? Or more generally, why do you prefer R?

"CALLING ALL DATA SCIENTISTS! Four minutes of your time can save thousands, if not millions, of lives!",Projects,"*TL;DR: fill this 4 min survey to save the planet :)* [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V)  
   
As you all know, governments across the planet are struggling to contain the spread of Covid-19. The reason behind this is simple: things are moving too quickly making it extremely difficult to keep track of what is happening and where it is happening. The answer is simple: **DATA**!

Until treatments and vaccines are developed, data is our greatest weapon against Covid-19, and it’s about time we used it. We are launching a global survey to collect and analyze data from citizens across the planet - the first of its kind in history- to help governments and our communities in their battle against the greatest challenge of the Internet Age.

All we are asking for is four minutes of your time to share this post and fill out this simple, completely anonymous survey that can save thousands, if not millions of lives, as well as the livelihoods of most small business owners and day laborers. If you answer these questions as accurately as possible, you will provide us with extremely valuable information that can reveal where outbreak zones are and how they have been developing over the past few weeks. That means seeing an early end to the mass quarantine measures currently being employed and enforced around the planet.

**How?** Well, for example, if thirty people on your block report that they have symptoms consistent with Covid-19, your local government will be able to act quickly to treat patients, contain the local spread, and warn those on your block to take extra steps to safeguard themselves. You yourself will be more cautious and will have a direct view of your neighborhood's status regarding the coronavirus.

Imagine the network effect, and application of wisdom of the crowd to actually get more insight and provide a new angle to specialist &amp; data analysts to come-up with the most impactful solutions.

All of this anonymous information will be released daily on Kaggle and Github so that researchers, data scientists, companies and governments can quickly access and analyze it.

Thank you for your patience, your input and your time, here is a link to the survey: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QFQJH7V)

The accuracy of any model that I fit is pathetic.

Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),Career,"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how.

[R] StellarGraph version 0.11 open-source Python Machine Learning Library for graphs just released,Tooling,"StellarGraph is an open-source library featuring state-of-the-art graph machine learning algorithms. The project is delivered as part of CSIRO's Data61.

Five algorithms and streamlined onboarding are only some of the major new features delivered in the [0.11 release](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/tag/v0.11.0) of the library, with substantial API, documentation and demo improvements to support users in running and exploring StellarGraph functionality.

New algorithms include:

* Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them.
* Deep Graph Infomax: performs unsupervised node representation learning.
* Temporal Random Walks (Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings): random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred.
* ComplEx: computes multiplicative complex-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.
* DistMult: computes multiplicative real-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/755)

A sixth algorithm remains under active development, but is available in this release as an experimental preview:

* GCNSupervisedGraphClassification: supervised graph classification model based on Graph Convolutional layers (GCN).

The new release incorporates extensive enhancements and bug fixes, some of which include: 

* StellarGraph.to\_adjacency\_matrix is at least 15 times faster on undirected graphs[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/932)
* ClusterNodeGenerator is noticeably faster, reducing the time taken to train and predict with a ClusterGCN model 
* Addition of a subgraph method for computing a node-induced subgraph
* Addition of a connected\_components method for computing the nodes involved in each connected component in a StellarGraph
* The info method has been improved for heterogeneous graphs with many types and also shows information about the size and type of each node type's feature vectors
* Four new datasets added to stellargraph.datasets
* Neo4j functionality is now tested on CI
* Example Jupyter notebooks can now be run directly in Google Colab and Binder
* New notebooks demonstrating how to construct a StellarGraph object from Pandas, and from NetworkX.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) to access StellarGraph and explore these enhancements. Details for breaking changes can also be reviewed here.  

We welcome your feedback and contributions.

How do you keep local data files ? Do you sync them up to a database / google drive? I'm confused about workflow,Discussion,"
The problem is that we sync our code up with git, but the data is stored
locally. So that if someone else wants to run the code or something there's
an issue.

The data comes from a mixture of sources

* most is from Google Storage
* some is from data scraping / whatever during the project
* some is processed data

I was thinking about having a local directory rsynced up to the data storage,
and sync on git pushes with a git hook.

An issue with this is that there would be duplication of data, for example,
if I have some `data.csv`, then it might originally be located at

```
storage/bucket_1/data.csv
```
I pull this down to my local project
```
project/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
and then I sync my local data up to storage again, putting it at
```
storage/bucket_2/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
So that data now exists in two places, which isn't so great.

I'm not aware of a process to prevent this though and would appreciate any
thoughts/considerations that others have.

Data collection for an Italian study about the Self and Morality,Projects,"Dear all,

I hope that everything is ok and that you are handling the quarantine well. I am currently a student in Milano doing my P.h.D. in Psychology. Furthermore, I am a Rossoneri in my heart for almost 20 years now (you can imagine that I am living the dream because I am living in Milano right now).

If you are bored and need something to fill your time I got the perfect solution for you. Could you fill out a questionnaire for a study I am doing? My data collection is not going well and I really need some participants. Furthermore, some of the items are pretty interesting and could help you dealing with the quarantine boredom (if it is present). So it's basically a win/win. My study is about the relationship between future self-continuity (do we feel connected to our future self or not) and moral decision making. In other words, I want to see whether the degree of our perceived connectedness to ourselves in the future is related to decisions we make about moral dilemmas.

**The questionnaire is for Italian speakers only.** This is an exploratory study and it would require approximately 40 minutes of your time. If you are interested you can check out the link below:

The importance of the data process in crating user centered technical solutions,Discussion,"Hi, not sure if this is the place to ask but here it goes. I'm currently writing my application to the data science (informatics) program at my school. In my essay I mentioned that I've gained a greater understanding of the data science process (collecting data, analyzing it, extracting insights from data).

The feedback I received from the advisers asks me how understanding this data process impacts the way we build a user centered technical solution.

I'm a bit stumped on what to say and would appreciate some thoughts. So far the only thing I've come up with is that it helps us break down the problem we are trying to address.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fp6oh7/the_importance_of_the_data_process_in_crating/,3,datascience,hi sure place ask go currently writing application data science informatics program school essay mentioned gained greater understanding data science process collecting data analyzing extracting insight data feedback received adviser asks understanding data process impact way build user centered technical solution bit stumped say would appreciate thought far thing come help u break problem trying address,importance data process crating user centered technical solution
Mahalanobis Distance out of two other Mahalanobis Distances,Discussion,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, but it seemed like the best one since Mahalanobis distance seems to be used for Machine Learning as well. This is for a work in Management though, so not Data Science per se, more Data Science adjacent I suppose.

After getting my head around the Mahalanobis distance, I found statistical significance in the variables I am using calculated with it. There is a pretty established author that measures the same thing I am trying to, and they publish their Mahalanobis Distances, but not their component variables, being that they use different variables to measure this construct. Their variables, and process of recovery is so obscure that it is unlikely that I'd be able to access them myself.

So, to get to the point as quickly as possible, I've was wondering if it is even worth it to look into if it is theoretically sound to aggregate two Mahalanobis Distances with the Mahalanobis Distance, for the same subjects. 

Or would it be better for me to use those my variables and include that distance as another variable. In the same vein, should some ponderation be made regarding how many variables each Mahalanobis distance computes?

I'm still looking at understanding better how Mahalanobis works, but if you guys could offer some input that would be great!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fpctf3/mahalanobis_distance_out_of_two_other_mahalanobis/,2,datascience,sure appropriate sub seemed like best one since mahalanobis distance seems used machine learning well work management though data science per se data science adjacent suppose getting head around mahalanobis distance found statistical significance variable using calculated pretty established author measure thing trying publish mahalanobis distance component variable use different variable measure construct variable process recovery obscure unlikely able access get point quickly possible wondering even worth look theoretically sound aggregate two mahalanobis distance mahalanobis distance subject would better use variable include distance another variable vein ponderation made regarding many variable mahalanobis distance computes still looking understanding better mahalanobis work guy could offer input would great,mahalanobis distance two mahalanobis distance

in `statsmodel` I like that you can used method *summary()* to print all the details and metrics of the regression, is there something similar for the `sklearn`? 

Also, I noticed that `sklearn` is easier for various plotting. However, I can simply use `seaborn` library.

Take a look at the list and closer inspect those which may be of interest to you. I hope you find something useful.

 
Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

 
Algebra

These algebra courses run the gamut from introductory algebra to linear models and matrix algebra. Algebra is helpful in computation and data science generally, and encompasses some of the main concepts in powering some machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Algebra I, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers algebra foundations, solving equations &amp; inequalities, working with units, linear equations &amp; graphs, forms of linear equations, systems of equations, inequalities (systems &amp; graphs), functions, sequences, absolute value &amp; piecewise functions, exponents &amp; radicals, exponential growth &amp; decay, quadratics (multiplying &amp; factoring), quadratic functions &amp; equations, irrational numbers.

Algebra II, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers polynomial arithmetic, complex numbers, polynomial factorization, polynomial division, polynomial graphs, rational exponents &amp; radicals, exponential models, logarithms, transformations of functions, equations, trigonometry, modeling, rational functions.

Linear Algebra, MIT (course)
This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices.

Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers, University of Texas at Austin (course)
Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.

Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra, Harvard (course)
In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.

 
Calculus

These calculus courses cover topics from preparatory precalculus through to differentiation, integration, to multivariate calculus and differential equations. Calculus has broad uses, generally, and contains core concepts which power neural networks work. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Precalculus, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers complex numbers, polynomials, composite functions, trigonometry, vectors, matrices, series, conic sections, probability and combinatorics.

Calculus 1, Khan Academy (course)

The course emphasises the key ideas and historical motivation for calculus, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics.

 
Statistics &amp; Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Big data or data engineering for NLP?,Discussion,"I am trying to find if  it makes sense that they often happen together: NLP, and data engineering or big data techniques (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, and Scala)

One classic example in Hadoop MapReduce is word count. I guess that doesn't count as NLP.

1. In NLP industrial positions, do natural language data often need data engineering or big data techniques, i.e. do natural language data often come as ""big data""? 

   Internet search engines likely require big data of natural language, but I guess there  are very few Internet search engine job positions.  Do most information retrieval positions also need to worry about big data? How about  other NLP applications.?

2. Natural languages are unstructured data. However, https://www.dataversity.net/natural-language-processing-big-data-powerful-combination/ said in 2014:

  &gt; As developed as big data analytics have become, they still really only excel at managing structured information.


  Have big data or data engineering techniques evolve for NLP already? If yes, how well are  NLP aware big data or data engineering techniques received in industry?


  Is it more often to convert natural language data to structured data, and then apply big data or data engineering techniques, or to apply  NLP aware big data or data engineering techniques directly to NLP big data?

3. Some other observerations and thoughts?

"Seeking collaborators with expertise in: data science, advanced signal processing, machine learning, computational modeling, graph-theoretic/network analysis",Networking,"I am starting a new lab this fall at Florida International University (FIU). Our lab will focus on **understanding the neurocognitive processes that allow for the emergence of cognitive control** (how the human brain/mind monitors and adapts itself overtime to achieve task goals). Moreover, we will seek to understand how this system develops across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. Towards this end, methods that I currently employ, include: (single-trial) ERP analyses, time-frequency analyses of EEG (power and phase relations), source-localization of EEG, traditional fMRI approaches (GLM-based), and basic computational modeling (drift-diffusion models). Our lab is currently purchasing a high-density EEG system and FIU houses an fMRI scanner.

I am **seeking collaborators** that may or may not currently work in the fields of psychology or neuroscience, but that have at least some **expertise in one or more of the following domains: data science, advanced signal processing, machine learning, computational modeling, graph-theoretic/network analysis.** *I am most interested in finding collaborators that can help generate the best science; location, status, affiliation, or degrees earned are not important.* I also intend to take on at least one PhD student this fall and welcome responses from prospective students.

The scientific goal of this collaboration will be to combine skillsets in order to test novel hypotheses regarding the human cognitive control system, its developmental trajectory across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. At a practical level, we would seek to produce high-impact publications and to generate pilot data for pursuing collaborative grant proposals. **Depending on the situation, initial funding may be available for potential collaborators, consultants, or contractors.**

job searching during COVID-19,Career,"I got my Masters in ECE from a good school 2 years ago, and I did an internship as a data scientist. After graduating I got data science offers but I ended up taking a job at a manufacturing site at a well known Fortune 100 company due to the high offer. I thought it'd be interesting to apply machine learning to a production environment. Unfortunately, only about 20% of my work deals with machine learning or data science.

Worst part is, the environment I'm in frowns upon working from home, even during this COVID-19 crisis. I really want out, and get a data science position in the next 3 month, preferably out in the West Coast but I'll take anything that's decent. I'm seriously considering quitting. I got $100k saved so I should survive for awhile. Just wonder how bad it's gonna look to future employers, and also I don't know the time frame to get a data science job in this recession...

The government declares this as a success but IMO it's actually way more. They don't declare the location of confirmed cases or any other stats.

"To All ""Data Scientists"" out there, Crowdsourcing COVID-19",Projects,"Recently there's massive influx of ""teams of data scientists"" looking to crowd source ideas for doing an analysis related task regarding the SARS-COV 2 or COVID-19.

I ask of you, please take into consideration data science is only useful for exploratory analysis at this point.

The algorithms are not objective and there's epidemiologists, virologists (read data scientists) who can do a better job at this than you. Statistical analysis will eat machine learning in this task. Don't pretend to use AI, it won't work.

Don't pretend to crowd source over kaggle, your data is old and stale the moment it comes out unless the outbreak has fully ended for a month in your data. If you have a skill you also need the expertise of people IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE. If your best work is overfitting some algorithm to be a kaggle ""grand master"" then please seriously consider studying decision making under risk and uncertainty and refrain from giving advice.

Machine learning is label (or bias) based, take into account that the labels could be wrong that the cleaning operations are wrong.

How do you peer review Data Science projects?,Discussion,"Hey everyone. :)

I'm Shay (written erroneously; pronounced Shy), a data science consultant out of Israel.

I've been dedicating a lot of thought to peer review in small data science teams (like the ones I use to run, and now consult to). Sure, some of it entails reviewing code, but a lot of our work products and processes are different, and require, I believe, a dedicated peer review process.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the topic. Is peer review a regular part of the work process in your team? Have you reviewed or been reviewed by a peer? What is your approach? What do you feel is still missing? Have you encountered any structured approaches to this process that are unique to DS/ML teams - especially small ones, where 1 project = 1 data scientist?

If you're interested in my approach so far - which we have started implementing at one of my clients', and I've actually reviewed a DS project using this procedure - you are more than welcome to take a look at this blog post, and shout at me for all of my mistakes (friends link, so no paywall): 😗

Best countries to immigrate to as a Data Scientist - from Iran!,Career,"Hey Everyone,

So after a decade of work as an economic analyst, business analyst and data scientist in Iran, I have come to realize that the local economy has zero interest in transforming into a more data-driven state. Data resources are scarce and something as crucial as EDA is frowned upon out of fear that it may expose financial corruption, contradict government-provided statistics, etc. The most exciting thing that could happen in a data scientist’s life here is creating recommender systems for e-commerce platforms, the ones that have not gone under as results of sanctions anyway.

Situation is so severe that the job search term “Data Scientist” which returns tons of opportunities for other nations, offers next to nothing in Iran (Try this with LinkedIn yourselves for an impression of what I am talking about.)

I’m 32, B.Sc. in Industrial Mathematics, M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering, (specializing in Technology Foresight and Sustainable Development) both from top technology schools in Iran. I do have a fairly solid track record in quantitative business analysis/development.

This great community has always helped me make informed decisions. I would welcome any advice as to which countries offer better prospects for an aspiring data person. I do realize that I may have to start by interning at a new company overseas and I am humble enough to do just that.

I have a challenge!,Discussion,"Hello fellow Data Scientists,

I'm gonna ask broad questions to try to gather as much feedback as I can and then decide what to do. Everything is a possibility at this stage, there are no right or wrong. I have some data background but it's not relevant and that's why I'm a bit stuck with my thoughts.

**Objective:** Create kind of an Hackaton/program with a company where at the end of the day Data is transformed into relevant business insights. Those insights will be capitalized to generate possible new business models.

**Some questions about:**

**People:** 

\- Should we have several teams working with data? how many people per team, 1 or more? how can they work together - can we assign several roles like: 1 to cross data, 1 to clean the data, etc (is this stupid? lol) ?

\- Are these people data scientists only? Should we have 1 business guy per team to give a different perspective?

\- Should we have Data Scientists in the morning and then business people during the evening?

**Data:** 

\- Should we start with raw data?

\- All the teams should start with the same Data?

\- Should we try to cross data from company with some public government data or other sources?

**Program:** 

\- A morning, 12h, 24h, 2 days? How much time do we need?

\- Should we specify some avenues to explore or let them search for everything?

\- What are the things I have to take into account?

&amp;#x200B;

I Know this is all too broad, vague, open and your answer will be ""It all depends on what you want"", but what I need here is your expertise and sensitivity. If it was you, what would you do, how and why? Do you have anything that had been done before as a good example?

The thing is the management thinks that if a paper is published for super resolution it will work on our data too, plus the Data science manager is sort of ""yes sir"" guy and makes us work on simply hit and trial, as of two years one thing I am sure that Data Science is not just simply trying anything till we reach accuracy without going through in details. The learning curve has just gone down to trying tessarct, kraken etc and same goes for Super resolution, just feed the data and see it works or not. I want to tell the management that it is not worth and we need a better resource on ML and DL who can actually break it down and guide us in a more logical and systematic direction instead of just trying different paper with a dataset which is exactly opposite to ours and trying random things (frameworks, just any random paper published). Now, if I say it directly, it won't go down well with my Data Science manager and if I don't I will have to suffer doing it again and again or eventually fired because I am sure we are not progressing in any direction.

How to progress as a data analyst while dealing with poor mental health?,Discussion,"I am a mid-twenties female data analyst with almost two years experience.

For context, I am someone who has struggled pretty badly with my mental health since 18. I have been trying to get therapy for years on our healthcare system but it has been an uphill battle. There are many reasons for my depression/anxiety but my work situation has not helped.

I feel a lot of anxiety about how I will progress in my career. The skills that I have picked up so far are minimal (my own fault). My experience is mostly with SQL and Excel, with some basic knowledge of Python and Apache Airflow. I have significant experience with two lesser known data visualisation tools. My university background is in Maths and Stats. My non-covid salary is around £30k.

I understand that a career in data requires a lot of self-study which I have not done enough of. I have started trying to put 45 minutes a day into self-study – at the moment I am trying to learn Tableau. Python is next on my list. However, many days I just feel so down and just being able to get through my actual work is all I can manage. And to be totally frank, I don’t feel capable of the work I’m doing now – particularly the more technical work. I like the analytical and mathematical side of it. I am starting to think that a career in accountancy would have been better suited to me as there is more of an established path in that role.

Over the next five years, my hope is to feel more secure and less anxious about the work I do/my role. I also want to be earning closer to £50k. 

Do you have any advice for how I can get there? I know a lot of this is going to depend on self-study. But are there any other careers that I could be looking into with my current skillset? Or is there a specific niche in my area I should be aiming for?

New to Data Analytics - Career Advice Needed,Discussion," 

Hi Everyone!

Quick Run Down of experience:

\---BS in Political Science from a decent undergrad school

\---Five years professional experience (healthcare sales, insurance, international logistics)

\---Currently working in Healthcare/Life Science Sales

\---Healthcare MBA Candidate

The MBA program I am in is heavily centered around descriptive data analytics/ advanced Excel usage which initially scared me to death but now I love it! Prior to this program I only had a basic understanding of Excel and now I am doing hypothesis testing, decision analysis, ANOVA, regression, etc which inspired me to pursue analytics.

Now for a few questions:

\--- I am currently working in healthcare sales and want to stay in that field for now. How does one even get started in analytics and how on Earth do you know when you are even ready for the leap? After my courses, I would consider myself advanced with Excel and understand different types of hypothesis testing but outside of classwork, I have never put it to use in the real world. What are the logical steps forward when you have the skills needed but have not actually applied them yet and how do you know you are ready?

\--- When you do realize you are ready, what type of jobs do you even apply for that are relevant to those skills? What job titles specifically do you look for that are in the realm of business analytics? I would like to do something where stats are involved because the hypothesis testing, probabilities, ANOVA, and all of those skills were fun to me. 

\--- People that have careers in business analysis, what skills do you use the most in each program and which ones are the most valuable?

\--- I have read online that you need a basic understanding of SQL, R, Tableau, and Python in addition to advanced Excel skills. What are the best and most cost efficient ways to get good enough with those programs? Also, how do you know when you are, ""good enough""?

\--- Since I wrapped up Descriptive Analytics, it be worthwhile to take the more advanced analytics courses at my university (Prescriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics, and Business Intelligence)?

\--- What steps should I take right now in order to be ready for a job in this field when I graduate in 2022?

"Google Tag Manager, Global Site tags, metrics...new to all this. Confused!",Discussion,"We have finished designing our landing page. Hooray! Pretty basic, as it’s our first time.

Landing page got a email sign-up field to be notified, and social icons (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) if user wish to share our website via their social accounts.

There’s also an About page, with a email sign-up bar at the top.

Both sign-ups are linked to the same automated campaign on Mailchimp. We got double opt-in set up.

None of us had done analytics before. We just know that we need GA.

Here’s what we think we should track:

- Website: how many visited the landing page and how many for the About page. No need to track 404 page. It is set to auto redirect users to our homepage and we only got the About section.
- How many people entered their email address through our forms
- How many actually confirmed their subscription (captured by Mailchimp)
- How many clicks on each social icon on our landing page
- How many likes, tweets or retweets, reposts about our site

We also plan to use Facebook ads to target potential users.

Is there an app/tool to see multiple sites' analytics at once?,Question,"Hi guys

I've Googled this pretty hard and can't find an answer, so I think this is the most appropriate subreddit to ask!

I have a few sites set up in Google Analytics, as I'm sure most people do, I need to compare a couple of sites side by side sometimes.

Toggling through the sites on the mobile app is nothing short of frustrating, and opening two or more browsers sessions and resizing them side by side is a bit annoying too.

So, I was wondering, is there a tool/app or something that would allow me to open 2-4 site's analytics in the same browser window or something?

I don't want to compare them by overlapping data in the same graph, rather seeing them in separate windows.

Hope that makes sense.

What are the most important math skills as an analyst?,Discussion,"I have very strong soft skills (I.e. communication, presentation, sales background, etc) as well as intermediate to strong skills with SQL and Python. Enough to be able to spin up and automate an executive dashboard within a day which tells a concise compelling story and can answer the ""so what"" or in other words, identify actionable information. I think the biggest piece I am missing in my toolset is any sort of mathematical domain knowledge. For example, I can easily find and visualize YoY or WoW metrics and tell the story of why that may have happened or what we should do given this information, but I wouldn't be able to identify how correlated two variables are or how a change in one variable may impact this other seemingly disconnected variable (I.e. How does paid search spend impact people who book direct). 

I have considered taking community college courses in math (self paced learning for math hasn't been as effective for some reason), but I'm not quite sure what level I should be targeting. For example, since Python is pretty powerful I'm not quite sure I need to understand the component parts of how to put together a regression analysis (though it would be helpful I'm sure), but I'm certain it would be useful to know when to use one and how to interpret the results.

Transitioning from EU to the US,Question,"Hi!

I’m looking into transitioning to the US from Sweden in the upcoming years. Haven’t decided on the state yet but somewhere near a HCOL area with decent job opportunities.

I’m currently working as a CRM Analyst at a small boutique consultancy firm. Since it’s within consultancy I get to try out a lot of different roles and projects. I’ve worked mostly within FMCG/Retail and e-commerce with some added experience within finance. I majored in Statistics and minored in economics and political science. However, I never finished my bachelor thesis because I managed to land a job before and Working full-time just took up all my time. Really underestimated the workload in consultancy.

My technical competences is mainly SQL and Excel. Can model in Python or R and have worked with SAS Enterprise when I worked in Finance, but wouldn’t say I’m anywhere near proficient enough to do it without guidande.

Besides that I’m also the lead analyst within an account at the firm so a lot of my time goes to planning, stakeholder management , presentations (reports, sales meetings etc) and onboarding Jr colleagues and developing my stream.

I’m not looking into any specific industry och specific analytics position but would like to know any tips on what I should consider when applying for Jobs.

Since I don’t have my bachelor degree I’m guessing that’s going to be a problem. I’m hoping my work experience will outweigh my lack in education.

How difficult is it to find a decent job with work experience instead of a degree? (I did study more than a bachelor but just didn’t turn in a complete version of my thesis)

I will probably leave Sweden in 1-3 years so have plenty of time to prepare, brush up on some technical skills , maybe finish my thesis (if I really have to) etc. So any tips, short or mid-term on how to position myself better on the job market in the US is appreciated!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/hbhbd6/transitioning_from_eu_to_the_us/,7,analytics,hi looking transitioning u sweden upcoming year decided state yet somewhere near hcol area decent job opportunity currently working crm analyst small boutique consultancy firm since within consultancy get try lot different role project worked mostly within fmcg retail e commerce added experience within finance majored statistic minored economics political science however never finished bachelor thesis managed land job working full time took time really underestimated workload consultancy technical competence mainly sql excel model python r worked sa enterprise worked finance say anywhere near proficient enough without guidande besides also lead analyst within account firm lot time go planning stakeholder management presentation report sale meeting etc onboarding jr colleague developing stream looking specific industry och specific analytics position would like know tip consider applying job since bachelor degree guessing going problem hoping work experience outweigh lack education difficult find decent job work experience instead degree study bachelor turn complete version thesis probably leave sweden year plenty time prepare brush technical skill maybe finish thesis really etc tip short mid term position better job market u appreciated,transitioning eu u

Having a good forecast helps to prioritize projects at the planning stage, and then helps to keep track of how quickly you are growing against the forecast, allowing you to spot problems as early as possible.

The very process of creating a forecasting model allows you to synchronize the team in terms of understanding the product’s growth model. It also provides a tool for assessing the impact of working on different areas of the model.

Today we will talk about building audience and revenue forecasts for your product using cohort analysis. We will also find out the pitfalls and difficulties of this process.

## Cohort analysis is the basis for forecasting audience, revenue, and other business metrics for your app

Cohort analysis is the basis for predicting the dynamics of the key metrics of your business.

This metric divides users into cohorts based on the month they started using the product.

This means that if you build the forecast of a certain metric for a specific cohort of users (those who started using the product in month X) then you can easily project the forecast to the entire product. Thus, the forecast of the entire product can be simplified by scaling it down to a single cohort, which is easier to study. Since the process will be identical among cohorts, the results can then be scaled up to the entire product.  
Forecasting the dynamics of the key metrics for a cohort of users is relatively easy because you can obtain it by analyzing historical data on older cohorts.

Now that we’ve discussed the basic idea behind building metric forecasts for a product, we can get into the different aspects of the process:

* Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product
* Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience and other metrics for a specific cohort of users
* Predicting the size of the cohorts that will come to the product in the future
* Using Google Sheet templates to predict revenue, audience numbers, and other metrics
* Understanding the nuances, pitfalls and difficulties within the process of building the forecast.

## Understanding the relation between the metrics (audience numbers, retention, revenue, etc.) of individual cohorts and the entire product

Consider the following product, let’s call it X.

### First month after launch

You launch product X in January 2019. In January (the first month after the launch), 1,000 new users come to the product, and they spend $100.

In January, the app’s MAU will be 1,000 users, and the revenue will be $100, since at the moment, the product is entirely represented by one cohort of users who came in January.

### Second month after launch

In February 2019, another thousand new users join the product. They spend another $100. At the same time, 700 of the users who came in January are retained in February. These users spend $70.

Thus, in February (the second month after the launch), the product’s MAU will be composed of the February cohort of active users (1,000 people) and what remains of the January cohort (700 retained users). That is, the audience will equal 1,000 + 700 = 1,700 users.

Revenue in the second month will be equal to $100 + $70 = $170. It will also encompass the revenue of the two currently available cohorts of users.

### Third month after launch

As in previous months, in March, we will add a third cohort of users (people who started using the product in March).The overall metrics will be the sum of metrics for the January, February and March cohorts at the end of March.

### Month-N after launch

When we reach the end of month N after the launch, we will have N cohorts of users based on the month the users started using the product. The MAU for the entire product for month N will be equal to the sum of the audiences of each of the available cohorts in month N.

### Why did we present the audience and revenue for each month as the sum of these metrics for individual cohorts?

The goal of this exercise was to show that the key metrics of your product in any month are directly determined by their corresponding values ​​in the cohorts of users, created based on the date the users joined the product.

This means that if we can predict the metric for all cohorts of users for a specific month, then we can easily get a forecast of this metric for the entire product (by summing the values ​​from all cohorts).

## Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience numbers and other metrics for a specific cohort of users

Predicting the dynamics of revenue, audience, or any other metric for a particular cohort of users is relatively simple. To do this, you need to use the cohort’s historical data.

Usually, you need to take the oldest relevant product cohorts in order to get their actual dynamics, and then project this dynamics to the new cohorts.

For example, to predict a monthly active audience (MAU), you can take the following steps:

1. Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate the MAU for this cohort by month. By “relevant” I mean that the cohort must reflect the current state of the product. In this context, a cohort that has existed before a major change to the product does not qualify as relevant.
2. Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this step you will obtain the monthly retention rate.
3. Using monthly retention, you can easily predict what will be the audience of a particular cohort of users for any month. To do this, multiply the size of the cohort by the retention rate of the corresponding month.
4. If you need to get the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the metric’s future dynamics:

* For example, if the cohort’s audience has been steadily decreasing by 3% every month starting from some point in time, then you can assume that the same trend will continue in the upcoming months.
* If the metric seems stable, you can assume that it won’t change in the coming months.
* There is no universal approach to this task. You will need to decide on a case-by-case basis.

Let’s look at how this will work in the example of the app X that we examined earlier in this essay.

1. We take those who came in January 2019 as an old relevant cohort of users.

2. Based on this cohort, we calculate the monthly retention rate of our product. To do this, we need to divide the audience number by the size of the cohort (1,000 users).

3. Now we can make the MAU forecast of other cohorts for the month we are interested in. For example, the Month 4 MAU of the cohort that came in May 2019 will be equal to the number of users in this cohort multiplied by 4th month retention (1,000 \* 70% = 700).

4. If we want to predict what the cohort’s MAU will be on Month 7, then we will need to assume what will happen with the monthly retention rate.

In our case, the task is simple: retention has remained steady since Month 1, so we can assume that it will remain the same in the following months. As we collect more data in the future, we can modify the forecast if we observe any changes to the retention rate.

The same procedure will help you to predict any other growth metric. Let’s see how this works on the product’s revenue forecast:

1. Take an old relevant cohort of users and calculate its month-by-month revenue.
2. Divide the resulting set of values ​​by the size of the cohort (the number of users in the cohort). At this point, you will receive an approximate revenue retention rate for a cohort of users.
3. Using the metric above, you can easily predict what the revenue of a particular cohort of users will be for any month. To do this, you need to multiply the cohort size by the value of the metric calculated in the previous step for the corresponding month.
4. If you need to obtain the dynamics of the predicted metric for months that go beyond what you can get on the basis of the oldest relevant cohorts, you will need to make an assumption about the future dynamics of the metric.

Forecasting metrics for a cohort of users is simple: first we get the data on how this metric changes for some old relevant cohort, and then we assume that other cohorts will have similar dynamics.

## Predicting the size of the future product’s cohorts

The last missing piece for creating a revenue or audience forecast is information about the size of future cohorts of users who will come to your product. That is, creating a forecast for the number of new users.

There is no universal way to predict the future number of new users, since the growth models of different products are fundamentally different.

To solve this problem, you will need to build a forecast of the number of new users for each of the distribution channels, based on the available levers and the limitations each of them has.

## Using Excel / Google Spreadsheet template to project audience numbers, revenue and other product metrics

At this point, we’ve have already discussed:

* How to forecast the number of new users in the future (i.e., estimated size of the future cohorts).
* How to forecast active users, revenue or other metrics for a specific cohort of users.
* How the metrics of user cohorts, selected based on the date users joined the product, make up the metrics of the entire product.

If you understand the logic behind all the above steps, then creating a forecast becomes a solely technical task.

You can find an example template for forecasting product revenue here \[[file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atuXlLQSrjIHEoscPeL8un8pbCn-Z_S9YhEg3-qWig8/edit#gid=0)\].

In this file, we forecast revenue for a product that was launched in January 2015. The forecast was made in October 2019. All the actual data in the file is highlighted in blue, and all of the forecast data is highlighted in yellow.

Creating a forecast works as follows:

1. We calculated the month-by-month revenue of the users of the oldest cohort (see row 11 in the file).
2. We divided the result from the previous step by the number of users in the cohort (see row 12 in the file).
3. We made a forecast of the number of new users from October 2019 to the last month that we want to have the forecast for.
4. Based on the vale obtained in step 2, we built a revenue forecast for all product cohorts, created based on the month users started using the product.
5. The only thing left is to add the values ​​of the cohorts in the right way to get the revenue of the whole product in future months.

Read all about how this forecasting approach is applied in practice in a previous essay where I talked about the future of Calm and other subscription-based apps after [the changes made in iOS 13.](https://gopractice.io/blog/change-in-ios-13-that-might-end-calm-1b-valuation/)

## Improving revenue and audience forecasting models for the app

### Make separate forecasts for the key audience segments

One way to improve the quality of forecasts is to calculate individual forecasts for the key segments of the audience.

For example, you can make separate forecasts for different distribution channels or for different markets where your business is represented.

The allocation of individual segments makes sense when the dynamics of the predicted metric in these segments is significantly different, or when the segments are governed by different laws (different levels of competition, different growth drivers). If you do not make forecasts for individual segments, then you may face a problem when the dynamics of the cohort’s metric will strongly depend on the distribution of users by the segments, which can change over time.

### Make sure to consider the future impact of product and marketing changes on the model’s key metrics

If you’re making a forecast for a year or a longer period of time, then it makes sense to consider how the team’s work will affect retention, monetization, and acquisition of new users over the year. Reflecting potential future changes in the model will depend on the kind of changes and the effects you expect from them.

Some companies make forecasts for the basic scenario where they assume there will be no significant changes to the core product metrics. This forecast is considered as the minimum expected level of product growth.

### Add seasonality to the forecast model

When calculating the dynamics of the metric based on the historical data, the seasonal effects are likely to smooth out or disappear. Seasonality has a strong impact in many industries, so it is important to make sure to correctly reflect this in your forecast.

Seasonality can be addressed in one of two ways: Either you can add it at the coefficient level for the total value of the metric for the entire business (coefficients for specific months of the year), or you can factor it in at the level of dynamics of the specific cohorts.

The second option gives a more accurate result, but it is more expensive to implement. The first option is simpler, but in some cases it may poorly reflect the influence of seasonality (especially if the product is going through rapid growth).

### Complete the forecast with other metrics that characterize your business

Often, after building a revenue and audience forecast and other key high-level metrics of your business, you can easily build an expected future P&amp;L or any other kind of reports.

For example, this way you can evaluate the future cash flows of your company, and understand how much money you can invest in new experimental products/projects next year.

## Pitfalls to avoid when forecasting revenue and audience numbers

### Prediction issues for apps with strong long-term retention

If you are working on an app with a stable long-term retention, and you are using a device\_id (device characteristic) as a unique user identifier in the analytics system, then you will encounter a rather unusual problem.

People change phones every year or every year and a half. If you consider a specific user who did this, then at the time of changing his device the following will happen:

* Activity from the original device\_id will disappear, which will be reflected in the data as a decrease in the retention rate.
* If the user installs the product on a new device, a new user will appear in the analytics system with a new device\_id, which will be reflected in the data as the growth of the new users.
* The problem occurs because this supposed “new user” will behave differently than usual new users.

This may seem like a minor problem at first glance, but it will have a strong impact on forecasts for products that have solid long-term retention rates. Forecasts hinge on being able to create accurate user cohorts. Without being able to place users in their respective cohorts, the forecasts made on their behavior will become inaccurate over time.

You can solve this problem by asking users to create an account in your product, so you will be able to identify them when they log in from a new device. You can also use more sophisticated ways to identify users based on their addresses or other data.

Some services make use of an unusual approach and form cohorts based on the moment users make their first purchase. Thus they make forecasts only with the customers and not any user. Everything that happens before the user’s first purchase in this case can be considered as part of a marketing funnel.

Slack uses this approach. This became clear when they published their data before going public. You can read more about Slack and their business model [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-as-we-go-remote/), [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-vs-teams-vs-workplace/) and [here](https://gopractice.io/blog/slack-ipo-reading-between-lines/).

### Your forecast ignores what is not included in the historical data

We used historical data to make forecasts. Therefore, in fact, we got a forecast of what will happen if everything stays the same as it was before.

As we found out during the COVID-19 pandemic, life and the world around us can change quite rapidly, and we cannot take such effects into account in advance. But at the same time, such a forecasting model gives you all the tools to conduct various kinds of stress tests on your product and evaluate their impact on high-level and business metrics.

For example, you can consider a scenario where the influx of the new users will be five times greater in order to assess the impact on the number of active users and understand how many servers you will need to support your product.

## You must have a deep understanding of the product’s growth model to build a high-quality accurate forecast

The described approach to forecasting is quite universal. It works for any metrics and for almost any kind of products and businesses. The quality of the forecast mainly depends on how well you understand your product, its growth model and the internal dynamics of the distribution channels and the market.

It is also crucial to understand that forecasting is a tool for exploring your product, finding the levers to drive key metrics, and conduct stress tests. A good model will allow you to evaluate the impact of various potential projects and development vectors on the topline metrics of your

Hi all!

I hate coding and am a product manager at Tractific. We are developing it to enable no-coders to analyze their data with the help of AI. The problem with other tools is they require 5-6 weeks of learning and also coding. (setting up .track functions, etc.)

What Tractific does is:

1. Integrates with a single line of code to your website
2. Finds the right metrics, analyzes the data, and creates graphs
3. Gives solutions like change the color of your features block or replace persona block with features block, etc. You can implement those solutions to increase your conversion rate. These solutions were basic examples but AI automatically gives them after analyzing it.

The interview went well, I would say, with a minor fuck up on my side. They asked me some questions, but used GA terms in their language, and I have used and learnt the tool in English, so I needed a bit time or gave a wrong answer (once) and once an answer which was not that full. Still they sent me a task which I had to complete and send it to them. It looks like that:  


Imagine this website has to be build from the ground up, and there is nothing done on it yet.

1.Which measures would you recommend the customer (the site owner) in terms of Web Analytics?  
2.Why are these measures important?  
3.What do you notice on this website as a whole?  


I will not post the site due to obvious reasons, and plus that it is not in English. This is E-Commerce Website, which focuses on gardening tools, like sprinkles, hoses, wooden houses, birds houses, seeds, plants, carports, everything for the home and garden basically. What I noticed is:  


1.They dont use GA, but another tool - Webtrends. Also no Facebook Pixel, which since they are in E-Commerce is a must, having in mind the recent deal between Facebook and Shopify. Always better to be prepared from early on, then to catch up later.

2.Not optimized for my resolution (screen zoom by default by laptop with 25% to 125%), so maybe deeper research on segment groups with this resolution and if there are higher bounce rates from the homepage or issues with the purchasing process. I cannot possibly go through all the pages, and maybe there is some behavioral pattern to be observed with users with such resolution, which is also the most popular in that country (found statistics, more than 14% use it). Also experiment with various OS, maybe MAC devices do not zoom in by default. It looked well on my other screen and phone.  


3.Homepage too heavy (too many pictures, categories, etc.) to navigate and differentiate through the various categories, I spent a lot of time (20-30) sec to figure out which one is a product category and what is a blog post, which gives advice on how to plan your trees correctly or how to select the best car port. I suggested using a price label on every category (f.e. starting at 99USD), this would be easier for the eyes, especially having in mind that the customer base is likely older (&gt;45 maybe even &gt;50). This demographic info is easy available through their databases and GA.  


4.HeatMap of customers to see how far they scroll down, how much time do they spend there (to see if these categories and stuff are really that hard to understand), maybe they flock to the search function immediately?  


4.Search bar is in the middle, while it ideally should be on the right or left. It still could expand through the middle, since it shows images and categories (very good search function if I have to be honest). I suggested looking through the searches and establishing new categories or top searches for the season / week, if there is enough data to figure out a trend.  


5.Where do the customers come from, is there a difference in the Landing Pages? I want to look at product pages with have higher exit / bounce rate and compare them to similar products, which convert better. Maybe the one has too much / too little info, and this can be optimized when building the new website.  


6.What is the traffic from pictures? Their pictures were randomly named f.e. asiud1123asx.jpg and no alt-tag. I suggested naming them with a brand and some specifications. f.e. when it is electrical equipment its power (15W), and if it is a hose, its length and color, just to get an idea.  


7.Purchasing process - is there a step which takes a little bit too long? I experimented with a test order, everything went smoothly, maybe the new web page should pop up with Street suggestions, so people do not mess them up (some are complicated). This would result in easier shipping and less shipment mistakes, even though they would have been caused up by the customer.  


8. Too big icons for payment and shipping methods, they looked like separate categories.  


9.Some E-Commerce statistics for the (converting) customers - is there a difference between landing pages for those who convert or not, how much time did they spent on the website, how many searches did they perform? Maybe customers who find their desired product with two searches are more likely to order than those who performed 3 searches and up.  Maybe converting customers are landing on ""more simplified"" webpages. Here I again have the homepage in mind, which is very hard to use and understand.

Non-profit data support,Question," 

Last  week I had a post “Interested in connecting with Data job recruiters”  and a post about looking for a junior to mid-level SQL data analyst.   Included in the search would also be finding  a non-profit organization as well to begin the data analyst journey  with. I have heard that this is a great way to gain some experience  while helping at the same time.   

Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to find a non-profit to approach do data support for? 

Is there a common type of problem or pain point non-profits have, that data support could help with?

Why my SAAS Business Stopped Using Google Analytics,Google Analytics,"I own a [SAAS business](https://ezbiolink.com/en) and we have recently ditched [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) for [PrivateAnalytix](https://privateanalytix.com) on my web site due to privacy concerns. Here are the pros and cons we have noticed in 3 months.

\- No privacy popup box

\- Smaller Code (quicker landing page load times)

\- Open Source

\- Simple stats. It might sound counter-intuitive, but Google Analytics tracks about 300 data points on every site user, which is an overkill. We have noticed that we have used about 12 out of those 300.

\- Ability to video record sessions. This is arguably one of the most important tools, as we just realized that we had a popup box on our landing page that was covering the ""Signup"" button on some Andoid phones. After replaying the session replays, we have realized that our conversions have gone up from 13% to about 20% on mobile phones. That is huge.

\- Heatmaps. We can see the hottest zones on any page. This is especially great when we perform A/B tests with two different landing pages.

\- There aren't many cons, but one of them is not an extremely precise tracking of users with PrivateAnalytix vs Google Analytics. Let me explain, Google uses cookies to track users (this is what mainly creates privacy issues). 

PrivateAnalytix doesn't use cookies and doesn't collect any user identifiable information. So if the same person from the same IP visits the site, PrivateAnalytics will think count this as 2 visits. 

Hope this helps you guys. I was fed up with privacy concerns of Google Analytics. Though it is free, they sell user information to their partners. PrivateAnalytix doesn't store PII, we own the data, we can do session replays and heatmaps.

GA - Is there a way to ignore attribution from a specific UTM?,Discussion,"I'll elaborate a bit - so - we have an issue for our ecomm site where our 'forgot password' email 'steals' last click attribution from our other channels. e.g - someone clicks from a facebook ad, goes to sign in, forgets their password, resets, then clicks through the email they received to reset their password. This means the original last click source (in this case, Facebook) gets overridden to Email.

The domain referral exclusion list could work, but would then block all other attribution from whatever domain the email click throughs come from.

So in short ... Is there a way to configure GA to 'ignore' a click through from a specific UTM?

To illustrate..

**Current attribution:**

* Google - first click
* Facebook - 2nd click
* Email forgot password link - 3rd and last click --&gt; Sale goes to 'Email'

**Desired attribution:**

* Google - first click
* Facebook - 2nd click
* Email forgot password link - GA configured to ignore the UTM and treat the prior click 'Social' as the last click attribution source.
* \--&gt; Sale goes to 'Facebook'

This sounds niche but is quite a pain - 'forgot password' makes up about 3% of our sales.

Any help or suggestions hugely appreciated.

Best agency to buy GA360 through,Question,"Hi there!

We're currently paying for GA360, but the agency we're buying it through has too much turnover in their account reps, and it ends up being a revolving door of people who can't get up to speed with our business, and the support we end up having to pay for ends up being sub-par (Google won't sell this directly; we have to pay for it through an agency).

Does anyone have a GA360 reseller in the US that they like?  We're a SaaS in education technology, but I don't think there are any agencies that specialize in edtech or SaaS specifically.  Mostly, if we're going to pay for support, we'd like to actually receive good support.  I've heard of SEER and they rank well for my search, so many a good place to start a conversation?

Also, has anyone gone through this before?  I'd assume switching providers isn't particularly difficult.

How to measure the impact of an in-app feature?,Question,"Hey guys,

I'm working for a small start up as the head of marketing performance. We're an entertainment app publisher and facing volatile performance right now. 

Relevant for context, before I start going into my initial question:
our app is tied with in-app credits, they're needed to use the key feature (entertainment) of the app. Every action needs 20 credits, the user get's 5 free credits per day for the login, 60 for the start, and we do offer a slot machine, with a free game per day, to win additional credits (first game of the day will most likely be a win of 3 credits). 

Unfortunately Google kicked us out of the Google Playstore, and we cut off the slot-feature, with our latest update. iOS users can still use the feature but new acquired android users (and older cohorts who update the app) can't use the feature now.

We do not have a bi-manager or data analyst in the team, so I'm trying to figure out things by myself. I was thinking about drawing correlation between the whole free credit contingent per day and the free credits won with the slot machine per day. If that's significant, I would try to draw correlation between the free credits contingent per day and daily revenue. Does that make sense or how would you approach this situation to measure if the feature had/has an impact on performance/revenue.

Which model for predicting downstream concentrations?,Discussion,"Hi there!

I'm relatively new to data science, and I'm currently working on building a model to predict downstream ammonium concentrations, based on concentrations at two other stations. I thought to use multiple linear regression. However, I noticed that there is heteroskedasticity in my residual plot. I've read that I could use weighted linear regression to correct this, but I wanted to be sure that linear regression is the right model to use first. Does anyone have any experience with modeling this type of data? If it does call for a linear regression, can two stations that are highly correlated to each other still be used? I know that one of the assumptions of linear regression is that the independent variables shouldn't be too correlated. Thanks!

Help with A/B testing price?,Discussion,"Just wondering how do you go about A/B testing price on an e-commerce site? I have used 2 methods both with drawbacks. Was wondering what alternatives you guys have.

**Method 1:** If I use Google Optimize, I am able to change the price a user sees.

Original: Price on page = $10

Variant 1: Price on page = $20

*Problem with Method 1:* However, even if I edit the page to show $20 when a user clicks Add to Cart, they would still add the $10 version of the product. Clearly, this is not ideal for testing purposes since I want to see how many users actually checked out at the $20 price point.

**Method 2:** Have different landing pages that show different products. Using my e-commerce plugin (WooCommerce), I can then add different prices for the same product (ie. add the same product twice just that they have different prices). This way the price a user sees is actually what is added to their cart.

Original (on homepage.com): Price on page = $10

Variant 1 (on homepage.com/variant1): Price on page = $20

*Problem with Method 2:* A user who lands on the $20 page can easily go back to the homepage ( to find that they are actually being charged more). This sounds like it would lead to negative customer experience.

Thinking of getting a BSc in CS. Is it worth it? Or is it better to learn analytical skills by myself,Discussion,"Hi everyone,

Before I start, a little bit of context :)

Age: 29

Country: Spain

&amp;#x200B;

Academic Background: BSc in Economics by the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona (Well positioned university in Europe with a strong Math/Stats program) and a Master Degree in Marketing Management (Once I finish my studies I realized that I was more interested in business and strategy rather than Economics)

&amp;#x200B;

Professional Background: B2B Product Marketing Manager in a Tech Multinacional Company. Full-time job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently aware about how the world if changing and I'm realizing that a more queantitative set of skills will make my profile more competitive in the labor market even if I'm not into a pure technical career. I'm currently interested in Marketing, Business and Strategy, and if it's possible, I'd like to keep my career focus in these fields, however, everytime I go to Linkedin and other Job Websites I see that having such sets of skills will we quite useful for futures jobs, even though these aren't BI/BA specific jobs, but it's always useful an analytical profile with a complete set of skills focused on SQL, R, Python, Excel...

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought on starting in getting BA/BI skills by myself such as learning SQL, R (did some back in my university days) and Python. Then go deeper on Excel and some Data Visualization programs like Power BI or Tableau. Go directly for the skills I need. However, in these days I though that perhaps getting a second BSc in CS will be ever more helpful in the long term even though I'm not interested in technical jobs, but more business and strategic ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about this is that I'm not a 18-20 year old guy anymore with no responsabilities. If I start to study CS I will have to do it while I'm in my full-time current job. In Spain BS and BA have a duration of 4 years, which means that if I'm get into this I will take at least 6-8 years to get the Bachelor taking into account that I work 8 hours minimum every day and it takes about 2 hours to travel home from work and vice versa. I don't think that I will have enough time to go a course by yeear. I wouldn't hesitate to do that if I was a bit younger, and even if a had a part-time job like working in a pizza corner or something like that, but right now if I take this decision I need to be aware that I will finish my degree with 35-37 years the BS in CS. However, If I do it I will have a very complete profile.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the point at which a decision is good is when the benefit / cost ratio is high. It is evident that the cost of taking this decision for me according to my circumstances will be high (not so much economically) in terms of time, effort, sacrificing free time to go to the gym, staying with my girlfriend, and other hobbies taking into account that I'll have to work in a serious full-time job while I'm studying a STEM Degree. The question is, will the benefit be as much or higher than the cost based on the fact that my interest continues to continue working in Marketing, Strategy and Business, but I would simply like to have a more technical profile?

&amp;#x200B;

how to become a data analyst from a pricing analyst?,Discussion,"Hi guys I am currently working as a pricing analyst and I majorly work on excel and very rarely on SAP when needed.

(2). I did finance and accounting back at uni and is it mandatory to pursue a degree in stats or maths to be eligible for becoming data analyst?

(3). Is there any legitimate program (consider CFA program for finance) that you would recommend for studying SQL, R, Python and Tableau (would be great if they provide certificate so I can put them on my resume to show)

(4). Most data analysts I know around me are coming from actuarial,maths,stats background academically, some of them have already learnt R Python during school. Would it even be possible for a person with no coding/maths background to get a role in data analytics? Is it even worth trying?

Ranking items with multiple variables,Question,"Hi all,

I have a list of shopping items with multiple variables (revenue, price, review quantity, and rating) and I'm not sure what is the best way to come up with a single ranking for those items.

I've tried a linear regression but I couldn't find a ""reasonable"" weight for each variable. Also, normalising the data gave me some distortions due to outliers.

I want to avoid having items that excel in just one variable to be on top of the ranking.

The only way I came up with was by splitting the items into quartiles for the first variable, then repeating the quartile split for each cluster considering a second variable and then repeating the process for the third and fourth variables (4&gt;16&gt;64&gt;256 clusters).
At the end, the top items would be those that were in the top quartile for every variable, followed by the items that were in the top quartile for 3 variables but in the 2nd quartile for the last variable and so on...

Thus that make sense at all? Is there a more robust way of doing such ranking?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/gxluvo/ranking_items_with_multiple_variables/,3,analytics,hi list shopping item multiple variable revenue price review quantity rating sure best way come single ranking item tried linear regression find reasonable weight variable also normalising data gave distortion due outlier want avoid item excel one variable top ranking way came splitting item quartile first variable repeating quartile split cluster considering second variable repeating process third fourth variable gt gt gt cluster end top item would top quartile every variable followed item top quartile variable nd quartile last variable thus make sense robust way ranking,ranking item multiple variable

Blending Facebook Ads data to customer records in WooCommerce through Google Data Studio,Question,"Hi all,

Last time I posted here I was looking for help with getting customer quality data from WooCommerce blended with the source they came in from, for a subscription-model client. What I needed to do was see how the ad group/campaign that converted a user affected their lifetime revenue, retention rate, and so on, so we can make better-informed decisions about the quality of each ad campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

To do that, I used the transaction ID within Google Ads as the join key to tie to the Trial ID within WooCommerce and visualized it within Data Studio. That's how we figured out the Google Ads data, and now I can browse number of cancellations, renewals, cancellation rates, average number of renewals, e.t.c on an individual ad level.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm trying to figure out a way to do the same for Facebook/Instagram Ads. Unfortunately, the same set up won't work, because some of the metrics I'd need to get data on an ad set/individual ad level aren't allowed in blended data by Google.

Junior Digital Analytics Consultant - Job Interview Tips &amp; Guidance Needed,Discussion,"Hi guys,

  
I am having Interview for Junior Digital Analytics Consultant position at a rather prestigious agency where I am based. The job description is:  


1. At the beginning support and later independent handling of digital analytics projects as consultant and key account manager for our customers
2. Conception of digital analytics solutions and strategies as well as ongoing support and improvement for our customers
3. Website traffic and campaign analysis and recommendations for our customers
4. Working close with out  Programmatic Marketing Team 
5. Research and ideas presentation
6. GAIQ would be lovely, but not a necessity  - **I have it GAIQ + some Google Ads certification**
7. Knowledge of Data Analysis with Excel -  **Not proficient, have done it in the past, but I can manage everything very fast through research**
8. Visualization with Tableau / Data Studio would be nice, but not necessity - **I have little experience with Tableau, can catch up rather quickly.**
9. Digital Marketing Know-How - **I am pretty good here**

&amp;#x200B;

I would be happy to get some tips regarding the interview. Now, have in mind that the HR loves me due to my past experience, so I have a plus here. I have GAIQ, but the thing is, I have not practiced it a lot - just like a language, I need a bit to master it, and once I start playing with it, I am confident I will get under its skin. I am usually quite modest about myself, but really, Digital Native is underestimation.  


The first interview will be with the HR, I guess there will be second one with a guy leading the Digital Analytics team, where I might need to show a skill or two of mine. It will likely be in a week from now.

I really do not know what the tasks look like in such a position. Is it like ""**Here is website A, take a look at GA and tell us what inefficiencies are to be found"", or being a Junior, I would be getting exact tasks, given by a higher ranked employee?** Input from people working in the field will be appreciated. Am I expected to start and be perfect from the very beginning? Knowing myself handling other tools, If I am doing this full time I should be at very advanced level in two to maximum three weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you guys think of any questions that might come during the interview?**

 There are other SEO / SEM Junior positions available too. I guess since I am favored by the HR she will try to find me a place, realizing my potential, he will want to ""help me"", if he thinks I am better fit there.  Is Junior in that field considered ""Trainee"" where you have a month or two of onboarding period before being on your own? I am kind of lost, and while all these answers will likely be answered during the first interview with the HR, I would like to hear some inputs.

Which is the most efficient way to aggregate and cross-check tables?,Question,"Hello i'm a biologist in the pharma industry working as a data analyst

Scenario: Had to merge and de-duplicate 5 excel tables from different providers. Data is very similar but each provider uses their own dictionaries (drug1, drug001, drg-01). As an excel user with little-to-no vba experience, i dont have other options than checking data manually and it is very time consuming.

I wanted to automate the process a bit and the best solution i came up with was to setting up this process in mySQL, in order to 1) import the excel tables 2) pattern/fuzzy match the data 3) Present an already de-duplicated output with a data provider count, in order to quantify how many times a drug is indexed across databases (kinda like a quality check)

I'd be willing to learn mySQL and do it myself but i realize its a lot of work (took me hours just to import 2 out of 5 tables using the mysql wizard in excel) so am considering hiring someone to get the job done. My idea is to build a cross-checking and reporting system to reduce analysis lead times from days to hours.

My question would be, is mysql the best choice for this task or are there other innovative solutions i should consider?

The easiest way I can think of would be to make 4-5 images (of charts ) which would change on button clicks and will show the respective time period.
But this is very primitive and would require a lot of manual work as charts have to be updated 1-2 times a week.

Ideally, the process would be:
get the data from the internet (download into excel). Then format it a bit and visualise by some software (power bi/tableau would be expensive I guess). Then publish/embed the report on my site.

Help: How do I become more dynamic in my career? I've realised I am too much of a specialist in one proprietary product and it may be harming my career. Have been unemployed for 3 months.,Question,"Hey all,

Hoping for some sound advice as I realise I might be in a terrible situation (or not - hoping you can assess it) in my career.

For the past 5 years I've been working with Qlik products and became somewhat of an expert at it.

The problem is, I've become so much of an expert that I can't confidently say I am good at anything else (e.g. other products such as Tableau, PowerBI etc) because I haven't delivered work in any other tools in the past 5 years.

In one way it's great because I am usually at the top when it comes to work projects around Qlik. But the down side is I have placed all of my eggs in one basket. The COVID19 situation has made me realise how exposed I am if there is no work besides this product.

So how do I dig myself out of this and diversify? Any advice?

Skills wise:

- Working in Business Intelligence.

- Expert level understanding of how to script in Qlik for data modelling and design.

- SQL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, COMMENT)

- Dimensional modelling concepts (e.g. Star Schema, Snowflake) having modelled this way for Qlik data models.

- Server configuration (e.g. clustering and multi-node server deployments for Qlik)

- Training and coaching juniors in the above for less experienced developers.

- Presenting, documentation (data specs, diagrams, training documentation, slide-decks, storytelling using data) etc.

- Consulting clients on the product, making performance better etc.

- Visualisation design best practices

- Trained many hundreds of people so can understand nuances of how people learn.

Overall I have 10 years experience in tech.

I am feeling very nervous about my situation and don't know what to do next so would appreciate any sound advice you may have.

Due to my unemployment I've been using LinkedIn and have noticed how so many people are so expert in so many products. I don't know if they are exaggerating or if it's genuinely the case so maybe this is also playing into my in-adequateness lately.

My aspiration is to become maybe less-hands on and go into roles which require a mixture of technical skills, working with people, presentations, and has elements of marketing. I believe my experience over the 10 years covers many of this, the problem is I am a specialist in a propertary software maybe?

For now I am happy to continue working on technical roles to keep bring food on the table for my family but I am acutely aware of the dangers of continuing down my current path.

To try and fight this, during my unemployment I have been learning on my own:

- Microsoft Power BI

- Cloud data warehousing tools.

- Python programming.

- Reading in general.


I'd really appreciate any advice on how to put myself in a better position in my career, or if you think I am overly anxious I'd appreciate an outside perspective.

This is something I am trying to get to grips with, some of my work is replacing the work people used to do with new technology and I don't know how to feel about it.

It means people are losing bread because their jobs become redundant.

Doing predictive analytics is trying to predict the future and even getting the algorithms to recommend best course of action. Isn't this what the leadership of a company used to do? Are they admitting the leaders themselves aren't good enough?

Are we admitting that human nature is flawed in the interest of capitalism? That for businesses all that matters is making money and helping Jeff Bezos become even more of a billionnaire, maybe even the first trillionnaire in a decade while more and more robots and drones are deployed to do the jobs people used to do.

I have heard that by letting tech do more work people used to do it frees them up to do other work. I'm not sure on this, I've yet to see any evidence. All I am seeing is the savings introduced by tech going into the pockets of the owners.

We use Segment for everything, tracking events on the website and sending to GA, Fb Pixel, etc
I have tried a number of things and I can’t get GA to report accurately on transactions or revenue - it counts transaction IDs and order values multiple times so for example a $150 order might be counted three times so GA says it’s a $450 order.
E-commerce is set up based on the Segment ‘Order Completed’ event, not on a destination URL so users refreshing the confirmation page shouldn’t be the cause of this. 
Segment is also not sending the events multiple times, as all Segment events are sent to BigQuery and they’re not duplicated there.

How do I compare these data sets?,Discussion," 

I want to test for difference in average time per action between 2 groups. I have data on total time per day and total actions per day over a period of days, ex: time = 120 and actions = 45 for Jan 1.

I was wondering what is the best way to average and compare the data. I was just finding the average( tn/an) (example below) for the range of dates and comparing between the groups using a t test with equal variance. However I think another way to calculate average is more appropriate to find the average time per action for each group. My example of why:

&amp;#x200B;

|Day|Time|Action|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|1|
|2|5|5|

The original average I did: average is (5/1+5/5) / 2 = 3 time per action.

However I think I should be using actions as the denominator since I want time per action. So it would be: (5+5) / (1+5) = 10/6 or 1.67 time per action. I feel like the second method is the best way to find the average time per action. However, I want to compare these 2 groups using a test test and I am unsure how to do that and what N should be to accurately test for significant difference, since my data is collected by day and not by individual action.

Any advice is welcome as is tips on how to do this is Excel or stata.

What's your take on the field of Urban Analytics and Smart Cities?,Discussion,"Lurker here so this is my first post. I apologize in advance if this topic isn't relevant in this sub, I tried the search bar with no results.

Long story short, I was lucky enough in having the opportunity to take a foreign masters degree on a full scholarship, but then the quarantine happened. I'm eyeing a program called 'Master in City Analytics' which accepts candidates from various backgrounds (built env, CS, econ, law, business, etc) so I'm hoping to get qualified. Things like geocoding, big data viz, Python, GIS, making dashboards, even use of VR, and lots of other tech stuff will be taught. I'm learning programming on/off for the past 2 years or so but my undergrad and work experience are in architecture. The way I see it, I view this as a subset or more specialized form of Urban/City Planning which I'm no stranger to.

I might be able to have the same scholarship opportunity again in 2021 depending on the Corona situation getting better. While it's a great opportunity (fully paid tuition with stipend, I can also work part-time while studying), it's still a 1.5 to 2-year commitment plus I'm required to return home and contribute to my home country, which I fully intend to do. My choice of program will be a make or break scenario that will affect my life for the next 5+ years, which kinda scares me.

So my question is, do you think the field of analytics applied in the urban/ city setting is something that will take-off in the future? Where is it now in the context of how it's being used globally? Do future cities really need such ""smart city"" analysts, even for developing (third-world) countries?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/gnoq0y/whats_your_take_on_the_field_of_urban_analytics/,2,analytics,lurker first post apologize advance topic relevant sub tried search bar result long story short lucky enough opportunity take foreign master degree full scholarship quarantine happened eyeing program called master city analytics accepts candidate various background built env c econ law business etc hoping get qualified thing like geocoding big data viz python gi making dashboard even use vr lot tech stuff taught learning programming past year undergrad work experience architecture way see view subset specialized form urban city planning stranger might able scholarship opportunity depending corona situation getting better great opportunity fully paid tuition stipend also work part time studying still year commitment plus required return home contribute home country fully intend choice program make break scenario affect life next year kinda scare question think field analytics applied urban city setting something take future context used globally future city really need smart city analyst even developing third world country,take field urban analytics smart city
Newbie question - Google Analytics - 20 Filter Limit in Advanced Segments,Question,"Hello Analytics Subreddit!

I would really appreciate some advice! 

I am working on a site with thousands of user-submitted posts as its main content. I have recently been grouping older posts into themed articles, linking to them from a new listicle style post on the site.

I started making segments to analyse how they were doing internally, and came upon a problem when I hit the 20 filter limit in GA - and some of these posts have links to 25 internal URLs.

I started reading about creating a piece of code I could insert into my target URLs to identify them as part of my campaign, but all my reading seems to be about external campaigns, whereas my review is 100% internal.

How would you analyze the effect of temperature in this scenario?,Question,"Let's say that each record represents an event that occurred on any given day.

1. Would you aggregate the number of occurrences by each degree in Fahrenheit and then plot the temperature against the aggregated values.
2. Would you aggregate the number of occurrences by the date, i.e. 1/1/2020, and then plot the temperature against the aggregated values.

Redirects results in useless data,Discussion,"Not sure how to explain this, since english isn't my native language. But i'll give it a shot, because this is a big problem for us.
 
We're trying to clean up out website. So we're using our web analytics tool to see, which pages have none or few visits. We think it is a good start for finding pages, that can be deleted.
 
But we have discovered that the web analytics tool have registered a lot of the pages two or more times. Usually due to redirects (which are generated automatic by our CMS, whenever there's the slightest change in a pages name/url).
 
That makes it quite hard to use the web analytics tool to clean up our site. Because pages, that seems to have none or few visits, in fact can have a lot of visits - but under different urls.
 
The company behind the web analytics tool are not helpfull; ""it's your own fault due to bad url-behavior"".
 
So at this point, it is a really difficult task to clean up our website.
 
Am i honestly a bit surprised, that the data from the web analytics tools are so full of ""noise"". Shouldn't it be possible for a web analytics tool to only count the final landing pages - and leave out all the redirecting pages?
 
I am fully aware, that sometimes it makes sense to have data for the redirecting pages. But in this case it's really poluting my data ...

So basically here's the main issue - the game is played on multiple different domains and all the domains share the same analytics, and it's hard to differentiate the traffic of my main domain, from the traffic of other domains.

What makes things even more complicated - is that in the game there's a check for new version, that contacts my main domain, and if the new version is available on my main domain - it displays a button in the game that redirects player to my main domain where he can play the newest version. And this is an important feature, because I want people play the game on my main domain as much as possible, because at some point I want to add ads. But this makes the thing even more complicated, because I don't know whether someone started playing on the other host, and than maybe moved to the main host, or is he playing on the other host the entire time? 

So here's my questions:

1. How do I check the traffic ONLY on my main domain, excluding those other domains?
2. How do I check the traffic ONLY on one of the other domains?
3. How do I check which of the other domains has most redirection to my central domain?

Would a career in data analytics suit a highly introverted person with a degree in actuarial science and experience as a business technology writer?,Question,"Quite a specific question, but I am a bit lost and looking for a suitable career that would fit my skills and experience. I am 29 and I have a degree in actuarial science. I didn't particularly enjoy my college course. I spent a year after college working as a trainee actuary, which confirmed that I didn't want to be an actuary. 

I then switched paths completely and became a freelance writer. I mostly write blog posts and articles about business technology, including cloud computing, AI, software development, and cybersecurity.

I don't enjoy working alone at home on my laptop anymore and my earnings aren't enough to save for a home. I am looking to transition back into office work. Ideally, I want to earn somewhere between $35 and $45k. 

As per the title, I'm highly introverted and prefer to do the bulk of my work alone. But I would like the social aspect that comes with working in an office. I would ideally like to do work that combines math, analytical skills, and written English ability. 

Would a data analyst job suit me? And if so, what specific software/skills should I learn how to do to improve my chances of finding a job? I have very minimal experience with SQL and I was planning on learning Python.

Using 2 RPD files on same server through same OBIEE tool,Discussion,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello Experts,

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to OBIEE tool , hence kindly bear with me if my query is basic in nature.

I have 2 RPD files, a.rpd and b.rpd. I need to switch between these 2 RPDs on same server and through same OBIEE tool.

Do I need to deploy both RPD on server to switch between these two through same OBIEE tool?

&amp;#x200B;

As per my own attempt, I can open both RPD file through Administration (obiee tool) : File --&gt; Open--&gt;Offline and without any deployment.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it mandatory to deploy both RPD at server to open it on line?

I guess I need to define 2 different ODBC system data sources for my repositories after deployment.

What Is Data Warehouse As a Service (DWaaS) and Why Would Analysts Need It - Overview,Discussion,"With a data warehouse, a business can consolidate and analyze all its information, deriving new insights that gave an edge over competitors.

Until recently, data warehouses were largely the domain of big business because its hardware and software infrastructure needs - data warehouses usually require a lot of data storage and computing power. With Data Warehouse As a Service (DWaaS), a business outsource those infrastructure headaches to someone else.

The following article (see the comment below) explains how DWaaS makes data warehouse infrastructure setup much easier, drastically cut or even eliminate the need of maintaining its infrastructure, lets you dynamically modify the scale of your data warehouse operation as your business circumstances change, and automate most the work of a traditional data warehouse engineering team.

The key advantages of full-service DWaaS for analysts are the following:

* Access to all business data easy and fast to quickly pull up the information you need
* Adding new sources of data is much easier
* Joining seemingly large numbers of tables from different sources",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/gkqqkc/what_is_data_warehouse_as_a_service_dwaas_and_why/,2,analytics,data warehouse business consolidate analyze information deriving new insight gave edge competitor recently data warehouse largely domain big business hardware software infrastructure need data warehouse usually require lot data storage computing power data warehouse service dwaas business outsource infrastructure headache someone else following article see comment explains dwaas make data warehouse infrastructure setup much easier drastically cut even eliminate need maintaining infrastructure let dynamically modify scale data warehouse operation business circumstance change automate work traditional data warehouse engineering team key advantage full service dwaas analyst following access business data easy fast quickly pull information need adding new source data much easier joining seemingly large number table different source,data warehouse service dwaas would analyst need overview
Accountant to Data Analyst/Business Intelligence,Discussion,"*Had posted this in* r/BusinessIntelligence *as well*

Apologies for long post - my first one! A bit of context, I recently quit my full time job. I was in accounting/audit (Canadian CA, CPA) and had moved into a more consulting/advisory role, with a total of about 7 years of experience at a B4 in Canada and Australia. I'm trying to pivot into the data science world and after some research (plus given my past experience as well as interest), I'd like to explore more of the data analyst/business intelligence route. I spent the last couple of weeks learning Python (finished Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera) and am planning to learn the basics of SQL and Tableau next. In terms of interest, base on the little exposure I have so far, I probably will have a bit more interest in Tableau (generally have enjoyed playing around with the visual aesthetics in PowerPoint presentations and telling stories from a visual perspective - don't think it's something I am particularly good at but am definitely looking to upscale this part the most).

Still working on defining what it is exactly that I am working towards but this is kind of the start. Would like to be in a position where I could use data to drive decision-making in more of an operations standpoint and away from finance/reporting but understand that finance/reporting is where I may need to start off. I also understand that I will most likely need to drop a level or two down from a manager position.

***My questions:***

1. What is the best/most efficient way to upscale? For example, I now know at a basic level how Python works but I don't think I can independently scrape a page. Should I take a more intermediate course or try to do a simple project to start with?
2. For SQL and Tableau, I'd previously taken a few beginner courses online but will probably need a bit more practice. Am planning on taking advantage Tableau's 90 day free learning. Similar to Q1, do I do a bit more self learning or start a small project?
3. How technical do I really need to get if I want to go more of the data analyst/business intelligence route? I know I won't be anywhere as experienced as the technical DS but figured it'd be good to have a basic understanding and working knowledge. I know that my strengths to move into this field will really be the soft skills and business acumen - figured that I would need to build up some technical capabilities.
4. Would it be useful to also brush up on stats and calculus? I've only done the basic Business Stats and Calc courses in university.
5. Is there even a need for this type of role? Any recommendations of what type of jobs there are? So far I've seen Data Analytics consulting groups within the B4 and other marketing/consulting agencies.
6. Any other advice is also greatly appreciated!

PII logged in Google Analytics. Should I use a data deletion request or delete users through User explorer API?,Google Analytics,"One of my clients accidentally logged email addresses of a few customers in their Google Analytics account and wants to get rid of it. PII is located in the Page dimension (url). All other dimensions are fine. The data was recorded for less than 1% of the users in this time frame.

As far as I know there are two options:

1. **Data deletion request** on the property level.  
\- Pro's:   
  \- it's what Google recommends you do with a PII breach.  
  \- it has a grace period of 7 days and after that it is quickly deleted.  
\- Con's:   
  \- it will eliminate all Page dimension data for this period, regardless of whether it contains PII.  
  \- it can delete data up to 3 days before/after the time period I specify
2. **Delete user through User report API.**  
\- Pro's: We lose less then 1% of the user data and retain Page data for the rest of the 99% of users which is quite important to this client.  
\- Con's:   
  \- It takes about two months for Google to clear server data with this type of request (or so it says).   
  \- I am not sure whether this will really delete all data that it needs to delete. Can somebody confirm that if I delete a user through User explorer it will also remove all un-aggregated references to that data?

In this case as the data breach pool is so small I'm leaning hard towards option 2. but I am looking for a second and third opinion if this is the correct decision.

In addition, I'm a director of analytics, and my company is in the stage of where descriptive analytics tops everything - so there's virtually no real use for masters level statistics... but there is a use of trying to bring business value from data, which would be a combination of business + technology, not business + math.

Data Studio Problem: Valid Formulae Not Working,Question,"Hi all. I've got a report to create within Data Studio and there's a column I need that I don't know how to get.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

Trying to see if acquisition method (like keyword, or UTMs) affects the quality of a customer: lifetime value, retention rate, e.t.c.

**Data**

I'm using a CSV from WooCommerce with the customer records and a direct import from Google Analytics. This data has to be joined by the Transaction ID in GA/Trial ID in WooCommerce to get it to blend in Google Data Studio.

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue** 

So, this report has 'Keyword' as the main dimension in a standard table. I need two more columns to connect to this: one with an aggregate of the ACTIVE subscriptions, and another with the aggregate of the CANCELLED subscriptions.

This data comes from a 'subscription status' column, which contains one of two values: 'cancelled' or 'active.' 

What I'm trying to do, and what I think I should be able to do, is use REGEX in a calculated metric column to count each 'cancelled' value and each 'active' value and express them as an aggregate: something like​

CASE     

WHEN REGEXP\_MATCH(Subscription Status, "".\*(cancelled).\*"")  THEN 1    

ELSE 0

END

The only problem is that this gets listed as a 'valid' formula before I hit apply, but then throws up system errors every single time. I've tried a number of variations on the above but hit the same problem no matter what I try.

"GA Custom Event with User-ID triggered thru the API, Views question",Google Analytics,"I have this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

I have User-ID feature enabled in my GA with session unification ON.

Inside my app when user logging I push userId to dataLayer and then I publish the custom event.

Inside my ""All View"" I can see 2 users witch is good (since merging still did not happen) and inside my User-ID View I can see just user with set User-ID

Now, the thing I noticed is that when the custom event that is published from the client is showing in both Non-UserID and UserID Views.

But when I publish Custom Event from the Server through the API (this needs to be done from server), With only passing User-ID That event is only showing inside User-ID View.

My question is is this expected? Or should I publish the Event from the Client directly through API with User-Id, or Session Unification will do the job and I'll only have 1 event showing instead of two, meaning that it will figure out that Event is actually associated to that specific User?

4)Checked on Google Analytics real-time events. Last 30 mins showed that there were 4 event triggers, 25% 50% 75% and 100% scrolls. These events show up in the behavior tab later.

Off My Chest. After almost 9+ interviews I cannot even get a simple Data Analyst job for almost 7 months now. Any advice?,Discussion,"I did my BSc in 2017, worked as a SQL analyst for 5 months and I completed my Data Science MSc end of last year. For a entry level analyst role I have the skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python, I even did a tableau course on Analysis/ Data Science.  One of my concern is my in depth knowledge on the tools and programs above as I have no idea how to compare myself to another analyst.

I have a speech impediment which as expected gets worse during interviews as I have to think on my feet really quickly. I feel like I struggle with the competency-based questions, because due to my stammer I cannot use the STAR method correctly. Most of my feedback from the interviews were I wasn't the right candidate and other had fit the bill etc etc. ""you weren't confident, and they felt I wasn't strong enough"". I have never doubted myself nor have I lost confidence.

Especially during the lock-down, it’s hard for me to get an interview as most companies are closed and those that are still hiring start from a telephone call. In terms of landing an interview I have refined my CV with professional help and most interview reaches the face-to-face stage.

I am really afraid that I will slowly lose all my knowledge and programming and analytical skills which will cause me to lose an interview in the future. My goal is to be a Data Science in the future but I cannot even land a entry level Data Analyst position.

Would appreciate if you guys can answer these questions.

* What does an entry Data Analyst do on day to day basis?
* What skills do I need to polish?
* Are there any alternative ways to answer the competency-based questions?

How to track engaged users in Google Analytics,Discussion,"I've done a bunch of research on the GA academy and on YouTube, but have not found an answer to this questions.

I don't know how this is possible in GA. I can get a list of people that have accessed my site, but I don't know how to segment them by actions performed.

I have a fitness application, and so an active user is someone who may:

\- Update their progress X times a week

\- Perform Y workouts a week

\- Or just check in Z times a week

Is this something that's even possible on GA, I'd imagine that it is, but ideally I don't want to move on to a paid analytics tool just yet.

Suspicious spikes in international referral traffic from cse.google.com: Problem or a non-issue?,Discussion,"I found that on 4/23 and 4/29 we had huge spikes in traffic from India. Our average daily visitor count from India month to month is 6-10. Visitors from India on those two days total 2181. 

In digging deeper I found the 2181 unique visits were all from India, all from cse.google.com, all from Android os on mobile devices and all using Chrome. 

I dug a little deeper and found hijackers may direct people's browsers to cse.google.com in order to generate click revenue. 

However, that's a little different than the issue we're facing - we're for some reason receiving traffic from the potentially hijacked cse.google.com URL, rather than the one forced to use it.

Can you check how I categorized my attributes as numerical vs categorical? (Student),Data,"Hi guys, I'm a student and have a big analytics project as part of a final. I'm very good at modeling and post-processing but am a bit weak at pre-processing. In order to make sure everything goes smoothly I'd like to make sure I'm correctly identifying datasets attributes as numerical vs categorical.

[Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ag3lAM-KbNjtwlXuMm8l6OkRwPRxI-lo/view?usp=sharing)

I've highlighted the attributes as per the classification I believe they are:

Green = Numerical

Yellow = Categorical

Red = Output

&amp;#x200B;

**My big questions regard attributes Q6, Q7, Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37.**

**Q6**:  I believe this is **categorical** because hours seems to be on a scale of \[less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, more than 6 hours\]. If not for the scale (finite options for survey it would be continuous)

**Q7**: I believe this to be **categorical**.  While it's a number, it may be categorical as it seems to be on a finite scale of \[0,1, 2, 3, 4+\] 

**Q35, Q36, &amp; Q37**: I don't understand these attributes as they're responses to ""Do you have any kids? - Yes/No \_\_\_"". On the surface they appear binary (Yes, No) and thus **categorical** but the max values for these attributes are 6, 7 &amp; 9 respectively perhaps indicating they are **continuous**. Perhaps you can infer what this really means. Perhaps it means for example ""Yes I have 6 kids that ride mountain bikes"". 

What really throws me is when a subject indicates they have kids by entering a value for Q35 and/or Q36, but simultaneously indicates they don't have kids by entering in a value for Q37. As of right now I'm going with **continuous** (numerical).

&amp;#x200B;

Even a guess will really help me out.

GA: Active Users - 1 day vs 30 day,Google Analytics,"Hi all, I've been reading up on some websites the difference between new users and returning users as well as active users over specific timelines. From my understanding, if you are looking at new users set to 30 days, any new user (does not have the cookie for a returning user or it isn't detected for various reasons) then it is logged once. If they come back within that month, they will not be recorded as a new user. If you set new users to be on daily, a new user could be considered new each day, just not more than once, right? 

Similarly, with active users, the number will likely be higher for monthly rather than daily because it's easier to have the user come back and be active once in the month rather than each day, right?

Dimensions in Data and Data Structures,Question,"I've been taking some online courses during quarantine about data science and analytics and came across something I'm not sure I understand. Both in MySQL and Pandas, the data structures are said to be two-dimensional. From my understanding, I always believed that dimensions in data had to do with additional variables/attributes, which coincide with additional columns of data in tables (e.g. a shirt's color, size, or style are all variables). Now when I learned that data structures in MySQL and Pandas were two-dimensional, I assumed this would mean a table with only two columns. This is obviously not the case since tables in both MySQL and Pandas can have hundreds of columns. So, my question is this: do I have an incorrect grasp on the dimensions of data? or are the dimensions being described by me versus the dimensions being described in MySQL/Pandas data structures two entirely different things?

I'm 24 and in the last 1.8 years in my job, I have done everything from Data analysis, MIS automation, Predictive Modelling to BI etc. I thoroughly enjoy doing this but I feel like I now want to be exposed to different kind of problems(sectors/industries- specifically large scale behavioural data analysis). I thought analytics consulting would be the place for me, but it is very difficult to get in without good pedigree. **I need some radically honest answers to the questions below, coz I am tired of listening to generic bullshit on the internet :** 

1. Where must my focus lie from here on? On getting a professional degree or changing from one analytics role to another? 
2. For a professional degree at this point, I have two options: Either to completely get into the business side of things by doing an MBA or get into the development/product side of things by doing a masters in Data Science. I am not a professional programmer, but as you know, a wee bit exposure to data science is enough to get you intoxicated enough to imagine yourself as a game-changing ML engineer at FANG or other giants. **How do i break this illusion and get to practically assessing myself if I have what it takes to get into AI/ML full time?**
3. The choice of an MBA (with specialization in Business Analytics) seems like a no brainer to me honestly , but I somehow feel like this will become a bootcamp scene where in I will be taught everything I could have learnt  had I just worked for a couple more years in the industry. **Anyone who has done an MBA (ivy/non-ivy), please let me know the precise non-gloated value that it has added to your life?**
4. **How to keep from becoming a non-essential in this industry? I feel like currently, Analytics is overflowing with a lot of passionate internet gen folks who now see the true value of big-data etc. If you were hiring someone in your team for an analytics role, what would you be looking for?** 
5. **How to keep nihilistic tendencies at bay ? I find myself just rotting in inaction** because I feel like there are already too many people doing what I wish to do to the best of their abilities(or atleast they claim to do so on fucking Linkedin) and that no matter what I do, I won't really matter in the larger scheme of things(especially in this industry)

To aspiring contemporary fashion brands,Discussion,"

PREFACE:
Consumerism is reaching a critical halt with the pandemic this therefore presents a problem for us aspiring brand entrepreneurs. The fashion industry is one of the markets suffering the most from this economical shift. With the following passage I will address two phenomena that inherently are affecting the fashion world.The first is a social economical stand point and the second is the “drake culture vulture” circumstance.


-A RIFT HAS BEEN CREATED ONCE AGAIN-

High end fashion and regular fast fashion are gonna have an enormous rift between these two industries.Why? The masses can’t spend their income on “extra things”.In 2018 consumerism was at an all time high ,that which separated high end with low end was non-existent.Accessible to all masses ,the rich were rich so who gives a fuck ,the middle class was wealthy and the lower class was able to be indebted cause of low interest rates in the majority of countries . Those interest rates are gonna sky rocket in these next months ,why ?

The banks need money cause they’re too busy giving loans to the majority businesses cause If you haven’t noticed ,there’s no consumerism in non dispensable products.The companies that pertain to these niches they’re all f-ing broke.Covid is bad but it’s triggered a bigger flu that could ever be contained.

Pretty much “An immense rift between high end fashion and low end fashion has segregated them once again”

-Formal informality potentially will be the next wave-

Taking into consideration the aforementioned.This now allows distinguished designers too expend more on lavish materials.Cause now their market shall be directed towards the high end buyers.More expensive materials , higher end cloths ,cuts that suit the wealthy(formality).The fashion market hasn’t been able to shift away from the typical graphic tees that have dominated the market since the 2010’s that deter from unique cut and sews.Perhaps this could be seen as a necessary evolution leaving behind the standard of mediocrity that has saturated the fashion world.

Ok now so the second is Drake “The culture vulture” it’s pretty apparent that celeb pop culture has a big influence on what we see as “desirable”. Drake Champaign papi ,this dude whatever he touches turns to gold now ,why cause he’s drake ! You cannot lie that he as an individual has had an influence on pop culture ,which ultimately translates into our daily lives as a society.

Drake up until recently has changed his market direction towards the uk grime scene ,he’s with other dudes now you can say which then transforms drake. The uk is becoming a power house for both music innovation and fashion innovation where high end brands like: 
Montcler,Heliot Emil , Aylx,Acw and the biggest one Stone Island seem to dominate this scene .Drake has notability been seen in his most previous music videos ONLY SPORTING THESE NEW UP AND COMING BRANDS , on his new song he mentions Alyx in his CHORUS ,now everybody is gonna be saying alyx and that’s Promotion bub! 
This will only help these brands become the center point of fashion trendsetters.

In conclusion I’d like to state that; with the nuances of technology and easily accessible softwares , globalization of markets.In our current era never has it been more easy to become an entrepreneur.

Data Blending Metrics with different naming in Google Data Studio,Discussion,"Hi All,

I have am trying to blend the data of 2 different data sources, one is data from Facebook ads in a google sheet, and the other is data from Google ads via Google Data Studio's direct connector.

The 2 platforms have slightly different naming for example the Google ads metric is called cost while the Facebook ads metric is called amount spent. There are also other examples like clicks vs link clicks and conversions vs custom conversions etc.

I am supposed to show the media spend data in a bar chart graph to compare media spend weekly, but after blending the data, I see 2 labels in the legend, one says cost and one says amount spent.

I used ""day"" as a join key. But how do i change it such that the legend labels are Google Ads Spend and Facebook ads Spend instead?

Asking for a raise,Discussion,"Hi everyone, here's a quick background on my situation: I recently graduated in December with a BS in Finance and minors in Comp Sci and Business Analytics. I've been working 2 internships the past year or so, both of which have mostly involved Power BI, SQL, and Excel doing a lot of ad hoc reporting, writing queries/making views, and some forecasting. 

One of the companies I had been working with was pretty inconsistent work, working on projects remotely every couple months when they need me. They had been paying me $17.50/hr (1099 so closer to $15/hr) as a student/intern, which was fine at the time, but I feel like now that I have a year or so of experience and a degree under my belt that my time is worth significantly more.

My boss from said company hit me up yesterday for the first time in a few months and said he had a new Power BI project for me which I fully intend on accepting but I want to ask for a raise and I'm hoping someone can give me advice:

1. How do I word this request? Do I need to explain myself and talk about how I'm more experienced/efficient, how I feel like my time is worth more than $17.50 an hour at this point? I think he knows how cheap that is for analytics work but I also still consider myself somewhat of a beginner. 
2. How much should I ask for? I was thinking around $25-30/hr but I'm not sure if that's too big of a jump from my previous rate of 17.50. I also am currently very desperate for any work I can get so I would hate for him to be like ""Well for $30/hr I can just do it myself""

I'm a small business owner looking to understand and leverage the data I have available; any resource recommendations to learn about doing so?,Question,"I co-founded 7 small restaurants (it's a chain) and 2 years into operation have a lot of data (customer-related, staff, financial, back-of-house) and want to know better what to do with it. Does anyone have say, a book, that they would recommend to put me in the right direction?

edit: So I think since my business is expanding rapidly now is a good time to invest in data management – but I don’t know what types of data are going to be most useful to me, how to structure the data, or how to present the data to extract the most value.

I want to understand the overall data that I could be capturing and analysing, select at least one major area of that data and to develop a model for how that data could best be used to help the chain further improve their business by giving us an edge over competitors.

Examples of data areas include:

• Data about customers, such as what they order, when, where, combined with demographic information  
• Data about suppliers and supplies, for example what is used, when, where, cost, condition, supplier, mass of waste  
•Data about stores and possible store locations, about costs and issues with transport  
•Data about staff

Does that make sense? :)

What data does SA360 use for auction time bidding?,Discussion,"Hi guys 

i hope everyone is coping well amongst all this covid madness. 

I wanted to reach out to understand what kind of data Googles sa360 uses for auction time bidding. Right out of the box does anyone know? is it a matter of linking your Google analytics account and then creating a dataflow between those platforms and then using your configured goals/events to send sa360 conversion and maybe revenue data at keyword level? is that the case?

Or is it another datasource? i.e. floodlights? google ads? your own internal data ? I want to understand that if you are using any of these latter datasources then where does the auction time bidding advantage come in? i.e. if you use floodlights where is sa360 getting that rich, contextualised data to decide on a bid at user level? i thought its only possible to do this if your data source going into sa360 is google analytics.

A desperately confused wannabe data analyst - any advice?,Discussion,"I'm a recent advanced science (pre-medical) undergrad from Sydney, Australia and have been leaning more and more towards becoming a data analyst over this past year. 

I'll try and keep this short and sweet; the huge volumes of information on how to become a data analyst I have encountered have been overwhelming. I'm at a stage now where I genuinely feel like this could be the right job for me - I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, I enjoy and am skilled as critical analysis and problem solving, and have found myself to easily understand and perform statistics and statistical analysis. I just don't know where to start!

I understand 'data analyst' is an extremely broad term, but I know I want to get my foot in the door and begin learning. In Australia, there appears to be a huge volume of demand for data analysts with little supply. As such, more masters degrees have come about in the field. Currently, the degree I am looking at is a Master of Analytics in the business faculty of one of the largest universities here. The degree involves learning programming (to a lesser extent than data science), ethics, foundations of analysis, visual representation of data etc etc. 

Here is my question - will completing a masters degree of this sort, while also expanding my own knowledge of programming/statistics etc in my own time, be a meaningful way to begin my career? 

My concerns include: 

\- While I am good at statistics, I have always struggled with maths 

\- Being a female, am I less likely to be taken seriously in the industry? 

\- Would a master of statistics/mathematics be significantly more useful than a master of analytics or data science? 

Completing a masters degree in the field is something I would really love to do, but I don't want to be wasting my time if it will have no real benefit.

Discussion topics for team meeting,Discussion," Hi all,

I work as an analyst in a tech department and every week we have a team meeting that is lead by a different person each week. It's my turn this week and I am asking for some inspiration on good analytics topics to hold a 30-minute discussion/debate.

Some more context:

\- Not all of us work with data, so a discussion on a really advanced, niche concept won't be suitable for everyone (unless it's high level like the applications of ML)

\- There are approximately 8 of us and the more interactive sessions tend to work better.

\- It has to be delivered remotely

\- No COVID-related topics.

Some recent sessions have been:

\- Discussion on data privacy (ethics, technologies, consequences)

\- AWS (each person chose an AWS they liked and gave a mini-presentation on it)

\- Discussion on digital identity

How do the projects you work on align with your own personal/career goals?

How large are the data sets that you work with and process?

How are you using these analytics to improve some aspect of operation or life?

What are your favorite data science websites or forums?

Should I proceed with an MSBA?,Discussion,"Hello!

I have applied to University of Minnesota's MSBA program for this year and have my interview coming up. I really want to join this program because the curriculum looks very comprehensive, the faculty is very knowledgeable, and the program has a great reputation. The only thing I am worried about is the tuition which is around $50K. If I knew the degree would not be super beneficial, I would not go for it. However, I am not that interested in my current field and am really looking into entering analytics and the industries I am passionate about. I have a background in Industrial Engineering but I don't have very good programming skills and I currently work in project management. I hear a lot of people say that they self-taught themselves the programming it helped them just as much as a master's.

Really would like some help or advice as a noob in web analytics.,Question,"Hey /r/analytics! 

I'm posting here to really seek for some help or advice in terms of web analytics. I recently landed a role as a data analyst for a web-related company. For anonymity purposes, I'll leave the company name out. It's a fairly small/medium-sized company, so unfortunately, due to some circumstances, when I joined the company, I became the only data analyst. However, I'm actually really really junior and I consider myself quite lucky to have gotten the role. I am also fairly new to the field, well, very new. And have limited domain knowledge. 

I'm writing here because I want to know if there's anyone on this sub that could provide me some resources/tools/tips/anything for me learn in regards to web analytics. Or perhaps be willing to connect with me and teach me a thing or two. 

At my current 'level', I'm able to somewhat be on the 'reporting' side of data. However, I want to (and need to) be able to improve myself to be able to generate 'insights' and stories from the insights. Some examples of things that I would love to know are:

* Are there any must-have visualizations that I should create to monitor specific metrics?
* How do I create 'pre-post analysis'?
* What should I look at if I want to see changes in 'shopper behavior'? I know there's a multitude of possibilities, but it would be nice to have some examples of where I can start to look at this.

And more. 

Anyways, if you've read this post, thank you very much.

"Should I group using Segments, Channel Grouping or Content Grouping?",Google Analytics,"I’m new to Google Analytics. I’m looking for ways to group different data in reports. For example, grouping all URLs that have a certain campaign tag in the Channel report, or all pages where the URL contains a certain word in the Pages report.

My question is regarding Segments v.s Channel Grouping v.s Content Grouping. It looks like you can group by channel and by content using only Segments. In that case, why not always use Segments for everything? Is there any pros/reasons to use Channel Grouping or Content Grouping (other than the fact that Content Grouping limits you to 5 groups)?

Is the job i was offered a good direction for a career in BI/DA? Or should i do a Masters instead?,Question,"I have recently accepted a job offer at large CPG beverage company as manager in their logistics department to start May 1st. Even though the title is ""Managee"" i would not have any direct reports. Anyhow, the role is quite analytical in that i would be responsible for generating insights out of their data, creating dashboards and effective data visualization. As well as budgeting, projects and building effective relationships with carriers. In the interview they said that they use Power BI a lot and it is very important. Also i need to be very advanced in Excel. From doing some research the company is quite innovative. They did not mention anything about python though.

Now, I also got admitted to a Master of Management Analytics also starting beginning of May. Now, I do not want to both this masters and starting a new job as I really do not want to burn out. In speaking with past students they told me this masters would require aside from weekly lectures to spend 20 hrs extra per studying and working on projects. I would do iconsider doing it while working if i was already used to my new job and such.

Social Analytics by Campaign,Question,"Hi,

I’m a bit unsure how I can achieve this segregation by campaign when it comes to social performance. Does anyone have experience with this?

I want to ultimately report using Data Studio. Looking at Supermetrics for API connection, but doesn’t really solve my problem of being able to group social post performance by campaign. Even if I can use a data vis option, any option would be good!

Objective :To show users most relevant posts at the top, basis his past interaction with the app.

Relevant post : The post he is most likely to interact with.

Step 1 : Determine input variables like upvote, downvote, time spent on post, etc.(Use the app to find out more input variables) by a user for every post

Step 1 is an important step which will determine how well your model wpuld work

Step 2 : Populate these variables with random data for each of the user

Step 3 : Based on your analysis of the data, create a mathematical formula to rank each post (Top ranked most will be shown to the user at first )

We will test your model, by entering values for the input variables for a post and checking the rank it outputs. Please state the what weightage you are assigning to each factor and why?

You can assume details, if any, that is missing in this task. Just state your assumptions in your submission.

Format : Please upload your excel with marked cells where we can enter values for input variables, and then it should output a rank in another cell. You can state your assumptions and reasons in the excel itself, on a different sheet

Question Regarding Mixing Data Sources in BI Tools,Question,"(Same post in /r/BusinessIntelligence)

I've been using Tableau for a few years now and I haven't been successful in creating reports mixing multiple data sources.

The problem here is when you do bring in multiple separate data sources, how can you display different fields in a table view. (Let's assume the data models and sources are set up correctly).These are two completely different sources and quite large, so it is not ideal to bring them in together as one data source.

I know Tableau has data blending but the thing is if a source uses different filters than the other source, how can i display fields from the second source cleanly without affecting the first source. I've been successful at times using a mix of LODs and different filters but it's not always effective.

Having that said (this isn't a tableau question), but my company has been trying out different BI tools such as Looker, SiSense, etc. and with their POCs, I haven't had any luck figuring if there's a clean way in showing data (tabular view) with multiple sources.

Any thoughts here in tackling this problem? I'm starting to think this might just be a BI 'problem' and prob not best practice in mixing in multiple data sources to create a view with such both.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/fy81gi/question_regarding_mixing_data_sources_in_bi_tools/,13,analytics,post r businessintelligence using tableau year successful creating report mixing multiple data source problem bring multiple separate data source display different field table view let assume data model source set correctly two completely different source quite large ideal bring together one data source know tableau data blending thing source us different filter source display field second source cleanly without affecting first source successful time using mix lods different filter always effective said tableau question company trying different bi tool looker sisense etc pocs luck figuring clean way showing data tabular view multiple source thought tackling problem starting think might bi problem prob best practice mixing multiple data source create view,question regarding mixing data source bi tool

"Help finding reports that are typical of Google Analytics, within Adobe Analytics?",Discussion,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to evaluate test results for a fairly large company that we have recently onboarded. Most clients I work with use Google Analytics, so while I am fairly experienced there,  AA seems like a completely different animal.

Setting up the workspace for the Control and Treatment test segments, as well as pulling in basic metrics (unique visitors, orders, etc), was fairly intuitive.

Items of interest--- and where I am really struggling--- is adding an Avg. Page Load Speed metric to my test results table, as well as breaking down the test results by Source/Medium (specifically looking for test performance related to organic traffic).

**Avg. Page Load Speed-**\-- is this something that simply isn't available by default (without prior customized setup)?

**Source/Medium--** I have looked through all the available dimensions, as well as what is referenced within ""Traffic Sources"" in the Reports suite (and ""Traffic Channel"" within ""Campaigns"", and I cannot find any reference to organic traffic. The best I found was a Traffic Channel report that reports ""Unspecified"" for all traffic.

Is this something that needs to be setup on the front end/customized to work within Adobe Analytics? Am I missing something?

How to store text to perform analytics on it?,Question,"Hi,

You must have read about sentimental analysis on unstructured data such as twitter feeds. But there are limitations to analysis of unstructured text mainly because you cannot expect people to tweet in a machine readable language and natural language processing is still not mature enough to make out the nuances in text.

I have a web based tool in which my colleagues enter comments (in English) related to the task they are assigned. Mostly difficulties, challenges they are facing in executing the task. I want to analyse these comments on a large scale. The good thing is that I can ask my colleagues to enter comments in a certain way which could perhaps be machine readable.

But I don't know what that way is. As analytics experts, can you please recommend what writing method would be best suited from the perspective of analytics.

I had another thought of limiting the inputs by giving my colleagues dropdown menus to select from, but I am sure I'll not be able to make the selection menu exhaustive enough to cover everything the user wants to say. also selecting through dropdowns is a bad idea from usability perspective.

Optimizing your website through COVID-19,Discussion,"Brooks Bell has been hosting weekly virtual roundtables with enterprise testing leaders across many different industries. Here are some of the more interesting takeaways from these conversations:

* Be intentional about what you want to learn about your customers during this time.
* Remember that running tests during a crisis doesn’t necessarily negate the results.
* If you *have* to launch a new product, feature or campaign without doing any testing, consider launching it to 95% of users and use the remaining 5% as a holdout group.
* Time is of the essence. We’re seeing a combination of tactics being used to speed up iteration: testing micro-step conversions, using holdout groups, planning for backtests or simply launching with a pre- and post-analysis. 
* Use data from your CDP to look at your website behavior in the context of demographic or location-based data.
* If your company has typically relied on an in-person experience to drive sales, you may have to do more work to educate your website visitors now that digital is the only option.
* Keep moving ahead with cautious optimism: If a test has already started, keep it running. Evaluate others on a case by case basis, and plan for multiple versions of the future - particularly as it relates to Q4 / peak season.

Internal recruiter looking for knowledge/resources to help hire Google Analytics professionals,Discussion,"New job as an internal recruiter for a Digital Marketing Consultancy and one of my primary responsibilities is to hire people for our analytics team-- so I am responsible for finding candidates on LinkedIn, conducting phone interviews, and building out our interview plan (skills we are assessing, best interview questions, etc.). We are consistently looking for Google Analytics talent of various skill-levels who have a broad set of skills and can manage the full implementation process from front to back for our clients. 

With that said, most of my background comes from being an IT Recruiter, hiring software developers for the most part. I thought it would be an easy transition but have been surprised by how difficult it  has been for me to truly understand the role. I'm having trouble visualizing what it even means to manage a full implementation process when I am describing the role to candidates, or the general questions I can ask candidates to understand their day-to-day and gauge their skill-levels. I have watched youtube videos and done plenty of google searches to understand the very basics but looking for knowledge or resources that can help with:

&amp;#x200B;

* what are the basics that candidates in these roles want to know about in regards to the day-to-day of the role, the complexity of the role, the skill-level required of the role (outside of ""2 years of experience with GA""). 
* what are the basic questions I can ask for a fluid conversation with candidates to learn about their background and dig deeper into the intricacies of their previous roles? For example, with software developers, I would ask questions about whether or not they are writing code from scratch,  understanding their strengths with front-end vs back-end development, the languages and frameworks they've used, understanding what it was they were developing, the stages of the SDLC they have worked in, who is responsible for testing code, deploying it, etc. 
* What can I ask that helps me identify and differentiate junior candidates from mid-level to senior candidates? What separates average from the highly skilled in these roles? How can I better understand the difference between a general GA person and someone handling the ""full implementation"" process?
* How can I work with our analytics team to explicitly identify exactly what we are looking for and the questions our more technical/hands-on interviewing team could be asking candidates?

Conversion Goal Tracking Stopped Suddenly in Google Analytics :( Pls Help troubleshoot!,Discussion,"I have recently been handed over a Google Analytics, Ads and Hubspot account for a business I'm responsible to plan and execute digital marketing for.

Etiquette for delayed results,Question,"So I have a question I was hoping to get y’all’s opinion on. This morning my boss asked me to verify one of our client’s numbers for their proposed changes to one of their revenue streams. I told him I could do it in about an hour and a half, which I felt was a huge overestimate to give me some cushion.

However, it’s been like three hours and I’m still not done because I made a rookie mistake earlier on and j caught it like an hour ago so now I have to fix it and then finish. 

My question is, do I send him a progress email explaining why it’s late, or do I keep working on it and explain when/if he emails me about it? 

What’s the etiquette for this? Normally I just walk by his office or he walks to my cubicle. Actually, I’m rarely this late on one of his requests so this is not something I’m used to dealing with.

Thoughts?

Edit:

So I was writing the email when my boss called my cell phone and I just gave him an update then.

[Q] How was I supposed to tackle this email response rate / control group size interview question for market analyst?,Question,"Essentially it’s something like:

Email marketing campaigns in the past that consisted of a control group of 10,000 resulted in a response rate of 20%. We then wanted to decrease the size of the control group to 1,000 and saw our new response rate at 15%. 

We want to further lower our control group size but still be confident we can measure the difference in response rate with statistical significance. What do you recommend?

So my very generic answer was to “make sure” that we personalize these emails the further we decrease these control groups, as to more accurately target the right people and maintain that response rate. Meh..

Furthermore, I suggested if we’re not already, we need to have automated these emails and have them be triggered as soon as the consumer takes the necessary action, such as purchasing a specific product so that they receive the emails in a timely manner.

As you can, these were all very generic, conceptual answers on my part. I could not wrap my head around the first thing to do so that was the best I could come up with at the moment lol.

Is there way to display max cpc bids over time in data studio?,Discussion,"I'm working on analyzing my Google Ads account in Google Data Studio.

* Set dimensions to Campaign, Search keyword, and Search keyword match type
* Set metrics to Impressions, Clicks, Search Lost IS (rank) and Avg. CPC
* Set comparison Date Range to Previous Period

This is decently helpful because I can at least see whether the other metrics are changed by higher or lower avg CPC. However, it'd be nicer to know how they're related to my bid, because that's something I can more directly control. Unfortunately, I see no way to add the bid as a metric.

"Hey everyone, I'm working on a project and could use some help getting started...",Discussion,"**Overview:**

So the data is from a lending company who's main product provides loans to emerging markets, and the customer base consists of individuals who use the product regularly to grow their business, while others use it for more on demand purposes. My goal is to create and define a new metric called ""Active Customers"". I am performing my analysis using RStudio.

**Some of the deliverables that I want to pursue include:** 

\- Defining what an active customer is, and the cutoff threshold for how long they should be considered an active customer.

\- Summarize ""Customer Retention Rates"" based on the newly defined Active Customer definition. 

**Data:**

All the data is customer loan history from customers who signed up in Q1 of 2017. I've already performed the data cleansing and have a little over 1.3 million observations and reduced my dataset to 10 variables. Each row of data represents a loan application and their are some customers with multiple applications. Some of my left over variables are: 

\- Date of application

\- Approval decision of application

\- Disbursement date

\- Loan amount disbursed

\- Number of repayments made

\- Due date

\- Loan outstanding

So, how do I go about defining what an active customer is using the information above? Should I perform some kind of analysis or just make a general assumption/definition based on general business standards. I personally think that If a customer has applied for more than one loan and/or currently has a loan outstanding, then they are considered an ""Active Customer""; and, if the customer has no outstanding loans or has only one application that was reject then they are not considered ""Active"". How should I go about defining the ""Active Customer"" metric with the sample data listed above.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/fjabbo/hey_everyone_im_working_on_a_project_and_could/,2,analytics,overview data lending company main product provides loan emerging market customer base consists individual use product regularly grow business others use demand purpose goal create define new metric called active customer performing analysis using rstudio deliverable want pursue include defining active customer cutoff threshold long considered active customer summarize customer retention rate based newly defined active customer definition data data customer loan history customer signed q already performed data cleansing little million observation reduced dataset variable row data represents loan application customer multiple application left variable date application approval decision application disbursement date loan amount disbursed number repayment made due date loan outstanding go defining active customer using information perform kind analysis make general assumption definition based general business standard personally think customer applied one loan currently loan outstanding considered active customer customer outstanding loan one application reject considered active go defining active customer metric sample data listed,hey everyone working project could use help getting started

Does GA sample data for use by Google?,Discussion,"Hi there,

I'm not very proficient with GA yet (we mainly use other toolsets), but I recall when GA was first becoming a thing, there were a lot of discussions regarding how if you're not paying for what is today called 360, Google would take samples of your data to use for their own purposes, marketing or otherwise. Is this still true to this day? Is that the cost of doing business if you use GA but don't pay for 360?

There are all these lovely EULAs and whatnot, but as usual they're about as impenetrable as a bank vault to the layman. I understand they don't collect identifiable information (email, names, etc.), but to what extent can I really call my data ""secure"" if I use GA? Can I, with a straight face, tell my clients that only I have access to the data we collect, or is that a lie if I use GA?

Any and all help with understanding this further would be greatly appreciated!

Huge Disparity Between Organic Sessions (GA) &amp; Clicks (GSC),Discussion,"I just took over a client's website not too long ago and I noticed that there is a huge difference between the clicks from GSC and organic sessions on GA, particularly on blog pages (AMP-enabled).

For example (Data from 1 to 9 March 2020):

Blog page 1: Organic Sessions=176; Clicks=262

Blog Page 2: Organic Sessions=161; Clicks=320

(I know GA and GSC use different metrics and disparity between the data from GA and GSC is normal but I think the disparity between the data for my client's website is too huge)

I tried to dive down the data into desktop, mobile and tablet visits for the same period.

On GA, there were 1,099 organic sessions from mobile device and while on GSC, there were 5,189 clicks from mobile device (No problem for Desktop &amp; Tablet). So I thought it might just be the issue with AMP. On GSC, it shows that most clicks were generated from AMP results. I checked the landing pages on GA and there was no pages with URLs ending with /amp on GA. I did a real-time checking using my own mobile phone but no hit was recorded. I also tried to set up AMP GTM container and implemented it on the website (Wordpress), but no hit was recorded too when I tested it using real-time.

dynamic dataLayer.push GTM Clarification,Discussion,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to clarify the **process of how a dataLayer works with GTM**. As we're going to be dataLayer event driven going forwards. Could someone  kindly give me some pointers whether the below is correct or not please:

&amp;#x200B;

1) developer creates the keys value pairs in the abstract model repository that lives in the backend of a page, and these keys and values are based on the analytics requirement i.e. data mapping 

&amp;#x200B;

2) once these values and keys are populated for the necessary page (s), a dataLayer.  push script is written and added below the GTM container tag on the page. For example:

 

window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || \[\];

window.dataLayer.push({

  event: ""gaEvent"",

  eventCategory: ""{eventCategory}"",

  eventAction: ""{eventAction}"",

  eventLabel: ""{eventLabel}"",

  eventValue: ""{eventValue}""

});

&amp;#x200B;

3) These events keys and values are surfaced through GTM from a dataLayer variable or JS variable 

&amp;#x200B;

4) These can then be used in tags and triggers 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this the way a conventional dataLayer works? So, are the steps above correct or am I missing anything? What i dont understand is, if i was to add scroll tracking based on the above configuration i'll need to add them as DLV then use it in my tags to create the scroll tracking?

Optimizing loan repayment when considering varying interest rates/principal amount.,Discussion,"Apologies if this is not the best place to ask this question, but I'm not sure where else to ask. I have been paying off my school loans for about 3 years now, and have successfully paid off one loan entirely that had the highest interest rate by far compared to my other loans. Once I paid this loan off, I moved on to target extra payments to the next highest interest rate loan. This loan, however, does not have the highest principal. My interest rates now range from 3.51% - 4.04%.

I know there is a tipping point where, to optimize my monthly payments, I should start targeting the loan with the highest principal instead of the loan with the highest interest rate. I would like to figure this out, and vaguely remember doing optimization problems in college OPR classes, but I am at a loss for an approach. Any help, resources, ideas, would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if there is any other clarifying information I can provide. Thank you.

Would you hire me into an analytics role?,Question,"I have a BS in Industrial Engineering. Got hired into a big industrial company out of college as an analyst. I got promoted fairly quickly into an operations research position - I do a lot of optimization and simulation modeling for supply chain. I work with data every day, taught myself R and Python a couple years ago and use them frequently, but mostly for automating analysis tasks, visualization, stats or regression. My role does not require machine learning knowledge, but I try to work in ML where there's room.

There seem to be more ""2 years of experience"" type roles in the analytics world. I like analytics equally if not more than OR and I think I would enjoy moving to a role in that area.

Do you think I've got the chops to make the move to something like an ""associate data scientist"" role?

Should I take an graduate level intro to Finance and Accounting class as my electives for my MS in Business Analytics?,Question,"I'm doing an accelerated MSBA and will graduate in July. My undergrad is in economics but my only official finance class was Risk Management and I took Financial Accounting. I did take a 12 hours in econometrics including financial econometrics and financial forecasting in my undergrad but I never really learned ""finance theory"" and I didn't care for my accounting class. 

In my MS I took 3 machine learning classes, a SQL class and as well 4 statistics classes. I'm pretty much at the point where everything else is easy now. All I need left to complete the degree is a data visualization and enterprise analytics class and 2 electives. My last semester is this summer and I can select 2 electives from the business school. My coworkers said that taking a finance and accounting class will round out my skills because my BA and MS are very quantitative but having domain knowledge will be very useful. 

I currently work for the government as a Data Analyst focusing on housing. I'm proficient in R and SQL. I know python but it's not my preferred language. I like researching housing markets and other factors of it such as homelessness and those living at the poverty line. There is definitely room for me to climb in the analytics department and continue to work in housing. Any ideas or thoughts?

How can I make the best of this new job that is not as analytical as I hoped?,Discussion,"Background:

I have a BS in Statistics and I know how to use the common tools (Excel, SQL, Python, R, etc) but no working experience in Analytics. Since graduating college I was working in education (teaching math), with the idea of eventually transitioning into data analysis (and even more eventually, data science).

Current situation:

After sending out a lot of online applications, I finally got hired as an Analyst! I work at an ad agency and I started two weeks ago. The job is above the salary I was looking for, the benefits are great, and the work environment is great.

However, I’m not doing any data analysis.

Before I got hired, I could tell from the job description that the role wasn’t as analytical as some other roles I was looking at, as most of the description was devoted to managing projects. But another part of the description mentioned that I would be aggregating data and presenting reports, plus they said they would prefer Business/Math/Stats majors and proficiency in Excel. I still decided to apply, figuring it would be a good entry-level transition into Analytics, even if I was just using Excel.

During the interview they did the usual review of my prior experience. They specifically asked if I could create Excel macros and use VBA, and seemed excited that I had those skills.

On my first day, while going through orientation with IT, the IT guy mentioned that Analysts should download Python and SQL Server to their laptops. I was surprised, since thus far I expected I would be using Excel, but excited that I would be able to use more advanced tools on the job.

During training I learned the in-house and third-party tools the company uses for their workflow, but nothing to do with data analysis. I knew that project management was part of my job description, so I figured the analysis part of my training would come a bit later. After a week of training, I finally asked my supervisor when I would start doing data analysis, and he clarified that at that company they use the term Analyst for entry-level positions. For instance, if you were in the Planning department your roles would be Analyst, Planning; Supervisor, Planning; Director, Planning. An actual data analyst would be in the Analytics department (eg, Analyst, Analytics). It finally dawned on me that I had not been hired to do any data analysis.

I wasn’t the only one who was confused. I spoke to the other Analysts that were hired around the same time as me, and they were also wondering when they would be analyzing data.

I’m a bit disappointed, obviously. But I’m not in a position to quit this job, nor do I want to. I was financially unstable before, frequently dipping into my dwindling savings, and this new job has given me a lot of security.

Since I’m not planning to quit this job, what can I do to make the most it and gain experience for a future Data Analyst role? Luckily my current job isn’t completely divorced from data—in fact a large bulk of it has to do with data governance, so hopefully I can connect that to data analysis somehow. Also I may still be making reports, though in a very limited fashion. Plus I have the opportunity to gain a lot of valuable domain knowledge for the advertising industry.

What I’m doing right now:

-Using my free time at work and at home to develop my skills in SQL, Excel, etc.

-Attending local Data Science meetings to learn and meet people. Just recently I met someone who said he’d be happy to put in a good word for me at his job, so I’m holding onto that lead.

What I’m planning to do:

-Introduce myself to the Analytics team and ask about their work (I’m shy so this is surprisingly hard lol. Luckily they sit right behind me)

-Ask my boss if I can devote some of my free time at work to helping the Analytics team. I’m planning to wait until I’ve been here longer before making this possibly odd request.

Shady google managing parters. Can we buy google analytics 360 directly from Google?,Discussion,"Recently we acquired google analytics 360 via one of the google managing partners.

Their service plan is very basic (login issues, goal setting, and similar low-end tasks) and we quickly discovered that will provide no value at all. 

Now we are thinking to terminate 3rd party service agreement and keeping GA360. The 3rd party (google managing partner) stating that canceling their service will cancel GA 360...

Looking to expand SQL knowledge further into operational and customer service analytics,Question," 

Hello!

I posted in r/SQL but did not receive many responses, so I wanted to see if y'all in this sub could help a fella out!

I currently work on a Data Warehousing team and have a significant understanding in joining data, subquerying, case statements, applying business logic, etc. I am more looking to get into the side of using these tables to do further analysis to impact business decision making / optimization. 

I would like to learn more about how to utilize SQL to do operational analysis (particularly focused on customer service and optimization - think a team trying to close customer tickets, etc.). I do not know much about using date functions, and trending data over time in SQL and am looking for a place to learn more about this. Particularly what I am looking for is to answer questions like ""What is our average rate of ticket closure compared to daily levels?"" ""Have we been able to become more effective on resolving tickets, and reduced the time it takes to close tickets over time?"" ""What's the average first touch point to a ticket?"" Etc.

I have taken a look at Datacamp's exploratory analysis online learning, which was helpful, but I would like to continue delve into this area to further firm out my understanding. Are there any places to learn how to better structure queries / use SQL to do this type of analysis that you've found successful? I would like to continue to practice and have limited access to this type of data to do so. Any ideas would be helpful! I.E. how to get access to this type of data to practice, online learning, books, etc.

Any type of SQL is fine. Also, if this is not the place to post this, then please let me know where else I should do so!

Question: I have my GA+AW accounts linked - Do I still need GTM AW Conversion Tracking?,Discussion,"Hey all,

I am in the process of configuring my new real estate sites GTM and confused on the optimal AW+GA conversion tracking configuration.

* I have Goals created in GA and linked my AW and GA accounts. Additionally, I also have the standard GA (All pageview trigger) tag applied to my GTM.

My question is since I have my GA and AW accounts linked, do I also need to set up the AW conversion tag?

When I think about it is seems unnecessary, redundant, or could possibly inflate my metrics by double-counting leads - Am I assuming correctly that considering my goals are created in GA and my account is linked that the appropriate information is being captured?

Here is where I get really confused:

We use a platform called Sierra Interactive and they have a backend console (like most platforms) that allows us to enter our GA tracking code, Ad words conversion ID and Label, FB Pixel, etc.

My concern is that if I remove the AW Conversion code from the console and don't set up the conversion tracking code in GTM the system will not correctly tag incoming leads, even though I am appropriately linked via GA.

I am learning as I go, so I am not looking to do anything complex. The goal is to capture all the data from all of our lead sources and have them appropriately tagged in the system using GTM. I found that simply by entering the tracking codes, and IDs were limiting.

I know I am missing something, just don't know what.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/fbivgi/question_i_have_my_gaaw_accounts_linked_do_i/,1,analytics,hey process configuring new real estate site gtm confused optimal aw ga conversion tracking configuration goal created ga linked aw ga account additionally also standard ga pageview trigger tag applied gtm question since ga aw account linked also need set aw conversion tag think seems unnecessary redundant could possibly inflate metric double counting lead assuming correctly considering goal created ga account linked appropriate information captured get really confused use platform called sierra interactive backend console like platform allows u enter ga tracking code ad word conversion id label fb pixel etc concern remove aw conversion code console set conversion tracking code gtm system correctly tag incoming lead even though appropriately linked via ga learning go looking anything complex goal capture data lead source appropriately tagged system using gtm found simply entering tracking code id limiting know missing something know,question ga aw account linked still need gtm aw conversion tracking

Can someone help me figure out a way to get ownership of an Account and Property? Long story inside...,Question,"So I want to start off by saying I've been going through Google email, phone, and chat support for almost 2 months now.

ABC - Company my agency represents

CUNT - Their old IM agency

US - my agency

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's whats going on:

My agency manages client ABC. We handle their SEO, Internet Marketing, and Web Design. ABC used to use CUNT for their SEO and Marketing. CUNT was an awful agency and didn't show any progress or improvements, so they fired CUNT and hired us.

CUNT created an analytics account for ABC. ABC never had access to it as they delegated all work to CUNT. 

We took over ABC. I went to gain analytics access from CUNT, but he never responded to requests over the phone or email. On the phone, CUNT told me verbatim ""I have no access to that account anymore so I can't help you"". Ok, fine. So I contacted Google Support.

They had me prove authority to access the site. I did this by adding an analytics.txt to the domain as well as editing the Home page meta-description to show we have access to the back-end of the website as well.

I'm not quite sure what this process was for, since all Google had to do was send an email to CUNT asking CUNT to give US access to the account.

They did that and CUNT granted us access. However, CUNT only gave us read permissions. We need full ownership for obvious reasons. CUNT has absolutely nothing to do with ABC anymore. 

So I try to contact CUNT again and ask that he approves my management requests sent through email. He never approves these requests or responds to my separate emails. I go back and tell Google this, but all they will do is continue to send CUNT emails requesting ownership for US. This never works out because CUNT never approves the email.

So I get fed up and call CUNT today, and man was CUNT a cunt. He answers, I say ""Hello, this is John Doe with US, I had some questions about the analytics account for ABC if you had a minute or two?"".

CUNT says ""What do you want?""

I say ""Well we need ownership of ABC analytics so we can do with it what we need. You've giv----""

CUNT cut me off.

CUNT: ""I already worked with someone over there and got this taken care of.""

Me: ""Yes CUNT, that was me. Unfortunately we only got read access so we need ownershi---""

CUNT: ""I'M VERY BUSY.""

Me: ""Understandable. I simply need you to approve this request. You still use the email cunt@CUNT.com?""

CUNT: ""I haven't gotten any emails. I'M VERY BUSY!""

Me: ""Again, I understand. I'm sending another request right now if you could quickly check it while I'm on the phone with you?""

CUNT: ""Look, I am VERY BUSY. I don't have time for this.""

*Hangs up*

It's apparent that he has no interest in helping out and will never transfer the property to me. I've basically spammed him with management/ownership request emails at this point, and so had Google Support. I don't want to piss him off more though if he decides to delete ALL the data. 

I'm working on just downloading all the data separately and removing his tracking code and adding my own. This is my last resort though as we use tons of reporting softwares that require past analytics data.

I'm currently on hold with Google Support chat and have been for about 2 hours.

Does ANYBODY have any insights as to how I can get this fucking property? It's setting us back with ABC and I understand that CUNT is mad that his agency is so shit that they can't hold a simple client.

What can I do? Should I just download the data and start from scratch with a new account?

ABC even tried helping at one point by contacting CUNT, but that didn't work.

We have something called an attractiveness quotient that goes from 0 to 1. 
Following are the factores affecting attractive quotient:-

1. Eye color - has 4 categories ( blue, brown, hazel, green)

2. Hair color - has 3 categories (blonde, black, brunette)

3. Weight 
4. Height 

Now the question was to find the correlation of all these variables to attractiveness quotient. He gave me a hint that the magnitude by which each of these variables affects the attractiveness quotient will be different obviously. And he said the answer is purely based on statistics and no machine learning or anything.

I only know Pearson's coefficient in correlation but I am very sure that won't help here :(

How do I solve this? Or even approach this problem? And how do I treat those different categories in the first 2 variables.

I really wanna learn the answer to this and the concept.",40,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/f7q3nq/interview_question_that_i_couldnt_answer/,27,analytics,hi guy recently interview internship analytics position asked couple question answer one something called attractiveness quotient go following factores affecting attractive quotient eye color category blue brown hazel green hair color category blonde black brunette weight height question find correlation variable attractiveness quotient gave hint magnitude variable affect attractiveness quotient different obviously said answer purely based statistic machine learning anything know pearson coefficient correlation sure help solve even approach problem treat different category first variable really wanna learn answer concept,interview question answer

Career/Job Advice (from FP&amp;A to BI),Discussion,"  

hello,

I graduated with an accounting degree, was an accountant for 1 year and I am not a rly good accountant but after 1 year my boss suggested. me I apply to a new department that was forming up which is FP&amp;A (financial planning and analysis)

The reason he told me to apply was because I was good with power query, I knew how data flowed and was organized in the company and knew how to make relationship in power pivot and very basic DAX formula.

I need to mention all the data of the organisation are in a visual studio SSAS cube (same as power pivot but centralized when deployed)

Now my old boss was fire 2month after my promotion and he was the guy who built all the cube all table and linked and DAX and calculated column (pretty fucking advanced)

Now I've been 1year in the FP&amp;A position and I just got a bad review from my new boss (2/5). 2 main point of the review was, I was too much helping other department with the cube and wasn't focus enough on FP&amp;A, she told me some day I was 60% not at my desk because I was helping others. second point was that I sent some file without making enough validation before sending so there was some mistakes in it (as I said I am not the best accountant and honestly I do not have a lot of time to validate myself as I feel I am doing 4 jobs at the same time (FP&amp;A, Data modeler, IT Support, helping my old department in accounting as they are overwhelmed)

And it is true, but I am now the only person who has access and understand the cube in a 150ppl office. so yes, I often get calls from like the fiscality director saying he did a pivot table but numbers do not make sense, so I need to show up look at his slicers and realized he used the wrong measure or filter and help him out...Or I get a call from acocunting saying the new Accounting account she made in the accounting software doesn't show up in the pivot table and then I realized she didn't use an account from the master chart of account (my table in my model) so the account was showing in an empty row because it wasn't mapped, etc., etc., etc.

So at the end of the review we agreed I would let my senior (between me and my boss) know everytime I went to help an other department.

It has been a month since the review and I did let me senior know every single time I went to help, but everytime she told me it is fine to go after I tried to explained to her what the problem was or how critical it was. (So did I get a bad review for nothing? I do the exact samething as before the only difference is that I waste more time explaining it to my senior).

Anyway, I am writing this because I got a big demand from accounting this week so I told my senior it would take me 2-3days to implement, so she told my boss if it was okay, she said no you do not have time to waste 3 days on this, we are in year end and I need an analyst. So I had to see her because well this project is vital, accounting won't be able to be in compliance with the auditor without this project if it is not competed before FEB 27 (i did not told her that, because I thought she knew, but maybe she didn't, anyway) she agreed to let me work 2hours on the project but if it was more to just stop.

Of course it wasn't going to take 2 hours but I knew accounting needed it.... so what am I supposed to do? I told my senior this Friday before leaving that I would complete it during the weekend on my own time (like I have a choice...). and she replied if I would be able to show the DBA next week what I would have done, so I wouldn't have to deal with those thing in the future and be an analyst. I replied well it is not the DBA job to do the data modelisation (and I already spoke to the DBA prior to that and he agrees too, he is not an accountant and he doesn't know DAX, etc) and I saw on her face she just didn't understand and was a bit frustrated I wouldn't show the DBA (because for her it would solve the problem of me not having time to be an analyst)

I spoke to the IT director about that and he told me he wouldn't hire a full time Data scientist/Data modeler as we will probably change to an ERP software and it might replace the cube.

So now I am frustrated because I work and study BI and DAX and relationship model like crazy as I get stressed out something will crash anyday and I am the only one who understand what I do and how the data circulate in the organization. I just got told that everything I am studying might not exists in 2years anymore by the IT director. I got a bad review because I got too many responsibilities?!? I was also going to that interview expecting a stellar review and a big pay raise for all the stuff I do and the responsibilities I took... but I just think no one understands what I do....they just see me not performing as an analyst...and now I need to work pro bono during weekend to accomplish all my responsibilities without defying my boss max of 2 hours on this project...

I know I am a very bad communicator and I hate confrontation....I also just bought a house and I an now financially dependent on that job...I was kinda in shock during review so I just noded at everything when she was telling me why I got 2/5...maybe I should had try to confront my boss telling her it was a critical project and I needed to do it even if it was more than 2 hours.... but instead I just didn't confront her and I am doing it during my weekend...

anyway not sure what I expect from you guys.... but I do not thing it is sustainable to have that much anxiety about my future (ERP coming) and feeling guilty of helping other department when I know by boss doesn't like it... and feeling stress that the cube my old boss put in place, it is very advanced, and I am still pretty new to all this BI stuff, so I do not fully understands it either...I am also stress I might get fired by my boss since now I know she is unhappy with my performance...

anyway what would you guys do in my situation?

Ultimately I would love to keep studying BI and have a career in BI (as I really like this, a lot more than accounting/FP&amp;A) but I do not feel I know enough to switch job to a BI job.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/f7sujk/careerjob_advice_from_fpa_to_bi/,2,analytics,hello graduated accounting degree accountant year rly good accountant year bos suggested apply new department forming fp amp financial planning analysis reason told apply good power query knew data flowed organized company knew make relationship power pivot basic dax formula need mention data organisation visual studio ssa cube power pivot centralized deployed old bos fire month promotion guy built cube table linked dax calculated column pretty fucking advanced year fp amp position got bad review new bos main point review much helping department cube focus enough fp amp told day desk helping others second point sent file without making enough validation sending mistake said best accountant honestly lot time validate feel job time fp amp data modeler support helping old department accounting overwhelmed true person access understand cube ppl office yes often get call like fiscality director saying pivot table number make sense need show look slicer realized used wrong measure filter help get call acocunting saying new accounting account made accounting software show pivot table realized use account master chart account table model account showing empty row mapped etc etc etc end review agreed would let senior bos know everytime went help department month since review let senior know every single time went help everytime told fine go tried explained problem critical get bad review nothing exact samething difference waste time explaining senior anyway writing got big demand accounting week told senior would take day implement told bos okay said time waste day year end need analyst see well project vital accounting able compliance auditor without project competed feb told thought knew maybe anyway agreed let work hour project stop course going take hour knew accounting needed supposed told senior friday leaving would complete weekend time like choice replied would able show dba next week would done deal thing future analyst replied well dba job data modelisation already spoke dba prior agrees accountant know dax etc saw face understand bit frustrated show dba would solve problem time analyst spoke director told hire full time data scientist data modeler probably change erp software might replace cube frustrated work study bi dax relationship model like crazy get stressed something crash anyday one understand data circulate organization got told everything studying might exists year anymore director got bad review got many responsibility also going interview expecting stellar review big pay raise stuff responsibility took think one understands see performing analyst need work pro bono weekend accomplish responsibility without defying bos max hour project know bad communicator hate confrontation also bought house financially dependent job kinda shock review noded everything telling got maybe try confront bos telling critical project needed even hour instead confront weekend anyway sure expect guy thing sustainable much anxiety future erp coming feeling guilty helping department know bos like feeling stress cube old bos put place advanced still pretty new bi stuff fully understands either also stress might get fired bos since know unhappy performance anyway would guy situation ultimately would love keep studying bi career bi really like lot accounting fp amp feel know enough switch job bi job,career job advice fp amp bi

Custom segment changes Revenue,Google Analytics,"Hey,

Period 20/2-2019 to 20/2-2020 in Google Analytics. 

I’m on an internship and have stumbled upon something strange. According to GA, under Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Channels, Affiliates make up for 137 million Swedish crowns. So I drill down further &gt; Affiliates, and nothing changes obviously. So I wanted to check out how sessions from just affiliates generally look. I made a Custom Segment (Conditions &gt; Filter: Sessions &gt; Include: Default Channel Group &gt; Exactly matches &gt; Affiliates (Picked from drop down)). When I apply the Custom Segment, all of a sudden the revenue for affiliates drops to 106 million Swedish crowns. Even when I compare All Users with the Custom Segment, for All Users the same happens. When I remove the Custom Segment, it’s back to 137 million. 

Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong? Or why this happens?

Struggling to get an analytics role with an Economics degree. Advice?,Discussion,"I graduated in July 2019 with an Economics degree in the UK, and have been struggling to land myself an analytics position. I've been searching since end of the year, but no success so far. If I could get some advice from you guys it would be greatly appreciated.

Background: I am interested in business/data analytics in particular, but I am open to any similar roles that will benefit me. For various reasons I have put myself in a situation where I do not have any work experiences/internships, no network, or an impressive record of extracurricular activities while I was in uni (only 2/3 worth mentioning). The only leverage I have is the fact that it's a well-recognized degree with rigorous quantitative contents and I got a 2.1 in the end, which is great in itself but obviously it is not enough. I do not have any technical skills (e.g. R, Python SQL...).

I have been reading online about what could be done in my situation - including self-learning languages (R/Python/SQL), create a side project (like a data analysis blog), and I am also considering a masters degree, though I am not sure which course would give me the most flexibility in terms of job search, but I would like it to be more technical/quantitative to improve my technical analytical skills.

What should I be doing in the meantime to make sure I am improving my chances as productively as possible? If I were to go for a masters (which I am seriously considering anyway, regardless of my current employment status), which programs should be considered for an analytics role? Bear in mind I have an Economics degree, which puts heavy emphasis on Econometrics but I did not take extra statistical or technical modules that would have been beneficial to a masters course with heavier maths, but I would still like to keep it masthsy if possible.

Would my sister-in-law be able to become a business analyst with her experience?,Discussion,"I'm a software developer, so I have only a very limited idea of what business analysts do, but I'm trying to help my sister-in-law out. She's been at her company for about 6 years doing what *sounds like* a business analyst's job (again, I have a limited knowledge of ALL of your duties), but she is barely being compensated, and her employer refuses to give her a raise or a promotion after all these years.


Basically, she works at a trucking company, and she started as a receptionist years ago but was just... Slowly given more duties. First it was payroll. Then it was managing all of the dispatchers. Then it was creating intricate spreadsheets to manage the company's finanances that actually ended up saving them tons of money, and making other useful systems. They asked her to learn a bit of SQL to do some database queries, but then took her instructional materials away because they flat-out said they ""didn't want her learning too much"". She says that they're a small company, so they always hire relatives or buddies from college instead of promoting within. They've given her all of these responsibilities, and have literally made a new position title for her, but she's received maybe *one* raise.


She's a single mom, feels very stuck, and the amount she's making (45k a year) really isn't covering her expenses.

Advice on Tools for Finance Professionals to Learn to be Helpful in Analytics?,Discussion,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a CPA whose work experience, unsurprisingly, has been in financial reporting and analysis. I've always been a data geek and making decisions based on the stats presented as well as developing reports/dashboards/charts to monitor and assess the health of the business. 

I believe finance/accounting is moving toward this data-centric model and wanted to know what tools you recommend I learn to become more data-savvy as a finance professional and speak the same language as the IT/analytics departments at companies. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think going really in-depth on languages like Python/R might be overkill at the manager+ level in finance, even if big data completely takes over. SQL seems to be useful because it'll allow me to mine for data myself versus relying on IT. Tableau/PowerBI seem useful because I'll be able to present dashboards/charts that executives/finance professionals need to make decisions about profitability, etc. Is there anything else you've seen finance departments use, however, to make data collection and aggregation more efficient? I already have advanced knowledge of excel, but excel isn't the best tool when dealing with huge datasets at the moment.

Opinions on data warehouse software,Data,"Hello, everyone!

In my current position we have been using MSSMS for most of our data warehousing needs. Writing some basic to complex stored procedures, functions, and some SSIS to move, store, and transform our systems data. 

Around midway last year, the company purchased Jet Global software for out data warehouse solution. However, we have been having a lot of issues with it: timeout failures, execution packages running into each other and skipping, sometimes it just doesnt run. 

Some of the problems we have worked through with a consultant because the person who onboarded the software left almost immediately after without training anyone. So we have been trying, but... the more I learn about it the less I see value in it. Now I am still in the infancy of learning how to use it, but it seems like it was built for someone who doesnt know how to write SQL so they could have a DW. 

In my perspective everything it does, I can do in MSSMS faster. I see some good in it, for documentation, but even that seems pretty lackluster. 

Does anyone use a DW like jet? Do any of you use a different DW that you love?

HELP/INFORMATION NEEDED: How to Track Repeat Visitors,Question,"Here's the challenge I'm facing: how to track individual repeat visitors across sessions and devices. Is there software I can use to find out who is coming back to my site multiple times before converting?

Applying filters in Data Studio vs segments,Discussion,"I've created a dashboard in Data Studio with various high level metrics metrics (users, referrer, country, avg. session duration). I've used filters in Data Studio to filter based on a certain page on the website.

However, the engagement metrics (average session duration, pages/session) appear to be too small. I am assuming that's because the filter for the page of the website actually applies the filter first and then calculates the session duration of pages only within the returning results (i.e. it gives me the ""session duration"" of the page only).

However in G.A., using a segment for the page, the time on page metric is a lot higher than the average session duration metric on data studio using the filter.

I'm currently a data analyst for an organization and have been acting in the role for almost 2 years. The large portion of my role is dominated by report creation and modification inside of Oracle CX, as well as Sales analytics and statistics.

Currently, I have no formal qualifications outside of the completion of high school and a very small course in excel.

I'd consider my excel knowledge OK, I have working knowledge of functions such as VLOOKUP's and other somewhat advanced functions, however I have no knowledge of VBA.

I have a working knowledge of Oracle SQL, however again, this isn't too advanced. I can create some complex expressions but nothing too fancy, and I have no knowledge of script creation.
I am also branching out into data visualization through PowerBI. Making attractive and insightful visualizations is something I enjoy and take pride in.

I am seeking advice as to what areas (Programs/Languages) I should focus on, as well as what kind of formal qualifications I should pursue. I don't plan to take any time away from work to pursue full time study, however, there are many online part time programs through reputable universities in my country.

My next obstacle is figuring out why. Why is it that these products are over-indexing so well in our E-COMMERCE sales for Miami, but not nearly as much for our E-Commerce sales in Houston? I've got all this data at my finger tips, but being a pretty noob analyst, I need some help as to how I can identify more details about my customer. What can I look at in our order history that would signal something to me (using order history data to build this analysis). 

For more context, it is a particular jacket that is performing very well compared to our Total E-Commerce, consistently does well through December (especially in August, for some reason). Was not purchased on any discount. Various colors and sizes (no significant differences). Excludes bulk orders. 

Any help in terms of what data I should look at would be greatly appreciated. I seriously have so much of it its a bit overwhelming. 

&amp;#x200B;

How did you get your foot in the door?,Discussion," I am graduating with a degree called Business Analytics and Intelligence this May.

Is making a career change from QA Engineer to Data Analyst feasible?,Question,"Hi -

As the title suggests, I was wondering how feasible/easy it would be for me to change my position/career. I am currently into year two as a Junior QA Engineer for a Marketing Agency, where I design and execute test cases for many clients' data based on different requirements. I use SQL and Excel to pull data and Excel to create pivots, and utilize different functions like VLOOKUP for validation.

I also assist in managing different client dashboards with Tableau and Power BI.

The reason for asking is that my workload feels repetitive, and I do not feel fully challenged or even to a point where I see growth in my career.

GA Custom Channel Groupings Latency,Discussion,"I've been searching for a clear answer but coming up a bit short, so hope someone can give some more insight.

I created two custom channel groupings in GA based on new UTM's I created for our media channels. Everything I have read, it sounds like the channels should back-fill the data within 24-28 hours. However, it has been more than 2 days since I created the channels and all the data still isn't populating into the correct groupings. Some are starting to map, but a majority of the data isn't mapping.

So two questions:

1. How long does it really take for all the data to group and populate?
2. Should I create via Channel Settings &gt; Channel Grouping or Personal Tools &amp; Assets &gt; Custom Channel Grouping Beta? And what is the difference between the two?
3. What is the correct funneling or ordering for grouping?

1st Forecasting Project,Discussion,"Hi,

I’m taking on 3 new projects at work, one of them involves writing a forecasting model to forecast daily call volume. I have 3 entire years (Jan 2017 - Jan 2020) of daily call volume to use.

I’m reading up on ARMA, ARIMA, Vector Autoregression, etc but am unsure how to determine which is best. The call volume has decreased significantly YoY, 35% decrease from 2017 to 2018 and 12% decrease 2018 to 2019. Definitely a downward trend but no real seasonality so I’ve ruled out ARMA (please let me know if I’m right to). I’ll be using python and have briefly looked at the statsmodels package which has all/most of the models I’ve seen so far.

Strange New Pattern,Discussion,"After three years of owning a particular website and analyzing the stats daily, I've seen a new pattern for the past month:

They also seem to come to the site directly. 

This is a local retail business so I don't typically see visits from cities more than an hour away and when that does happening, they're almost always visiting from Facebook and the number of pages varies as well as the duration being much longer.

I'm in New Jersey and Yesterday I had 15 unique visitors from Boston, 4 from New York City, 1 from Miami, 1 from Smyrna GA, and many more similar - all visited 2 pages for 0 seconds, all throughout the day and night.

Is there a simple method to compare two sets of time series data and determine lead time?,Discussion,"This is beyond me and I've been spinning for days so any help or direction would be appreciated.

I have two data sets both comprising 52 weeks of data. The first data set is product shipments from my warehouse to my customer, the second is my customers sale to its consumers. I have been asked to determine (on average for the full year) the lead time between my shipments versus the consumer sale date, we use this approach because our forecasting process always starts with our market execution plans and works backwards to forecast our shipments to customers.

I'm hoping to bring some rigor to our approach, in the past we looked at charts to determine the   ""approximate"" lead time so it was a imprecise method.

Is there a regression approach or some other method which I could try and apply? I'm very unfamiliar with most math-heavy statistical approaches but I have likely work my way through if the method is clear to follow.

I've attached a simple chart &amp; data set to give an example. In the chart I've added from bars and arrows to visually indicate that there is an apparent relationship over time…now how I quantify it is my issue.

MS Business Analytics or join workforce?,Question,"Hi all,

I was recently accepted into my university’s MS in Business Analytics program. It’s a 16 month program that would cost between $40-50k once all is said and done with tuition and housing. I’m ecstatic to have been accepted, however I am not totally sold on the program just yet.

In my mind, there are two options: the first is to join the MS program, get 16 months of experience using tools and softwares relevant to my future career, work with industry professionals, and really hone my abilities in data analytics.

The second option would be to join the workforce and try to get a job in Marketing (my undergrad degree), and on my own initiative, practice data skills within my position in an attempt to move up/change roles either within the company or find a different job after having that chance to showcase my interest in a data-focused role.

If anyone has any experience transitioning from a non-data role to a data role without a Master’s degree, or if anyone found that a MS program really propelled their career, I would love to hear your input and am all ears. Thank you in advance.

Advice request from an Intern,Discussion,"Hello fellow analysts, This may be a question for anyone involved in database modeling..new grad student here interning while studying. I am in a marketing department in charge of tracking new products launch dates, and submitting them onto ecommerce platforms. To successfully list these products on ecommerce platforms, I must collect product information from 2 other departments &amp; other tables on sharepoint of those specific products. Lack of a centralized system, and countless columns in excel spreadsheets.

 I am trying to find a tool to make a database containing all of this data centralized and easily pulled.

Bubble in the Job Market for Analytics/Data Science?,Discussion,"I'm going to have to make a tough decision about whether to stay at my job or take another one pretty soon, and I've been thinking a little about the state of the industry and how it seems like there are not enough decent data people to go around for the amount of demand at the moment.

Should I stay in data science or move into media planning?,Discussion,"I work as an analyst at a media agency and recently came to a cross roads in my career. I've been in a business intelligence role for around 1.5 years (with a non-stem undergrad degree) and genuinely loved my job. I liked the data part, but the insight and recommendation part was what got me going. I used some Python and SQL in my day to day job, but gradually took on more automation focused projects just to make the data cleaning and reporting part of my job less tedious.

Near the end of last year, my team went through a restructure and I got pulled into a real data science role, with the chance to learn machine learning and cloud computing. I felt like I really lucked out with this, since now I can have the structural support to learn from experts at my agency instead of just googling. I also feel like I would have never gotten this job if I applied to it on my own without an internal push. But there is always some part of me that's still wondering if I'm smart enough to last in data science, and a second part that misses the media insights part of my BI role.

Recently, I saw an internal job post on for a media planning role in another city that I've been trying to relocate to for awhile. I applied to see what would happen, and actually got a call back. However, since it's a promotion, HR said that I'd have to notify my manager first before they can move forward. 

My dilemma is this, should I proceed with the planning role knowing that it'll detract me from data science? I want to learn more about the media side of things, but I've also heard that planning is gradually becoming more obsolete with the rise of analytics. The major pro is that this role is in the city that my s/o lives in, and an internal relo is alot easier than trying to find another job.The office in that city doesn't have a data science team but does have a BI team. I don't necessarily want to go back to a being a BI data monkey again, which is why I applied to strat instead. Should I just stay on my current data science team to gain more tech skills and learn about media strategy some other way? Another factor to consider is the pay.

Why your A/B tests take longer than they should,Discussion,"When conducting experiments, teams usually include all the active users in their tests, or sometimes they tend to add all the new users who join the app during this test. So when calculating the metrics for different test groups, all the data from the moment the A/B test kicks off is taken into account.

Today I’ll talk about how you can reduce the time required to get the signal on the change you are testing in a product. You can do that by changing the process of adding users to the A/B test, and in this essay I will show you how you can do it.

## Two approaches towards designing an A / B test

Let’s start with an example.

You’ve noticed that some app users abandon their purchase during checkout. The hypothesis is that with the help of a series of push notifications (reminders, testimonials from other customers, payment plans, etc.), we can convince some of the churned users to complete the purchase, which will have a positive impact on the app monetization.

The standard way to test a hypothesis using an A/B test is as follows:

1. Add all the active users to the A/B test and randomly split them into two groups (test and control).
2. In the test group, enable the push-notification logic we talked about earlier. The control group’s experience remains the same as before.
3. Measure the impact on the key metrics by comparing the performance of the two groups.

Here is the recommended way to validate a hypothesis using an A/B test:

1. Make sure to add users to the A/B test only at the point where we are going to change their experience in the product, i.e. send a push notification from the tested campaign for the first time.
2. Send a series of push notifications to the users from the test group; don’t send any notifications to the users from the control group.
3. Measure the impact on the key metrics by comparing the performance of the two groups.

The recommended experiment design involves two changes:

1. Make sure to add only those users to the test group who could experience the change in the product (we say “could” since we change the experience only for 50% of these users who will be randomly assigned to the test group).
2. When analyzing the results of the test, make sure to look at the data for these users only from the moment we added them to the test, and not from the moment we started the experiment.

An experiment designed according to these rules will require significantly less time to identify the effect of the change, if any. Let’s find out why.

## Make sure to add to your A/B test only those users who could feel the difference while using the product

Say you started an A/B test on April 1 and finished it on April 30.

The target metric in the experiment is the purchase conversion rate (the proportion of users in the groups who made a purchase).

* Purchase conversion rate in the control group will be 4.4% (4,000 + 400 / 100,000).
* Purchase conversion rate in the test group it will be 4.5% (4,000 + 500 / 100,000).
* There is no statistically significant difference. P-value = 28%. This means that there is a high probability that the observed change is accidental.

Now imagine that we added to the experiment only those who could get some new experience while using the product. And those are the users who abandoned their shopping cart while making a purchase.

Let’s calculate how changing the way of adding users to the test affected the conversion rate:

* Purchase conversion for users who have become part of the experiment will be 6.6% (400 / 6,000) in the control group and 8.3% (500 / 6,000) in the test group.
* This difference is statistically significant; even a smaller sample would have been enough to spot the effect of the change made.

When you populate the experiment with users whose experience is not different in test and control groups, you create noise in the data. It makes it harder to notice the signal that comes from users who have experienced the change we made. If the key metric is greatly influenced by the users with a similar experience, then it will take you much longer to identify the effect.

To draw an analogy, think of testing a drug. Let’s assume that for some reason, we add to the experiment not only people with the disease the drug is supposed to cure, but also people who are healthy. If we compare the proportion of healthy people in each of the groups after applying the drug, then healthy people will blur the drug effectiveness metrics intended to be tested on people who are sick.

In the example with the abandoned purchases, the users who immediately made the purchase will have a more significant impact on the test results than those who abandoned their purchase. At the same time, the changes we are testing have no influence on the users who made a purchase right away. Adding these users to the test will blur the effect that the changes will have on the real target of the test (the users who abandoned the purchase). As a result, it will take us much longer to observe the effect of the change we’ve made.

One technical issue is worth noting here. You can add all the users you have to the A/B test, and then analyze only those who could have experienced something new in the product. You can do that, but in most cases it will require some manual work afterwards. If you somehow automate the analyzing part of your test, it is better to only include users who will have a new experience.

## Use data only from the moment when users were added to the test

There is another way to blur the effect of the change you are testing. It happens when you take into account all the data from the moment when A/B test starts. To avoid this effect, you should only add data from the moment when each specific user becomes part of your test.

Most users spot something new in the product not at the moment when you start the test, but a bit later. You add extra noise to your data if you consider the time between starting the test and the moment the user becomes a part of it.

Here’s an example: You started the A/B test on April 1st. User X abandoned the purchase on April 10 and at this moment became a part of your experiment. It will be correct to consider data for this user only from April 10 when you will be calculating the metrics. The data obtained between April 1 and 10 doesn’t demonstrate the influence of the tested change on this user because her experience didn’t change during this period.

*In the example above, adding such data will not affect the conversion to purchase rate, but it may well affect other metrics.*

## How to understand the overall effect of a change made

The described approach of adding users to experiments reduces the time required to identify the possible effect of the changes made to your product. However, it slightly complicates the interpretation of the results, since in most cases everyone is interested in the effect of the change made on the whole product.

When you add only a part of our users to the test, the obtained changes in the metrics characterize the impact of the new feature on this group of users only. To understand how the whole product is affected, you need to make a series of calculations.

In the experiment described above, the increase in the number of users who made a purchase was 20% (remember, the experiment was designed in a way so that you only added users who abandoned the purchase to the A/B test). Let’s calculate what the overall impact on the metrics.

In the test group the users made 500 purchases after abandoning their previous shopping carts. In the control group the result was 400. If we consider the entire user base during the experiment, then there were 4,000 more users who made purchases right away in each group.

As a result, a 20% increase in the conversion of users abandoning their purchases translates to a 2% increase in the purchase conversion rate of the entire product (4,500 / 4,400 – 1 = 2%).

## How to log the data about A/B test

If you have your own infrastructure for experimentation, then feel free to simply create a table where you will store the information for each of the tests in the following way:

* User
* Experiment
* Group (control/test)
* Date and time added to the test

When you have this data handy, it won’t be difficult to calculate the metrics for the test and control groups in respect to the principles we’ve described above.

If you are using analytics software, you can add a property to the user with the name of the experiment and the test group’s title at the moment when this user becomes a part of the experiment. During your future analysis, you will simply need to filter events according to these properties.

How to prepare for final interview?,Discussion,"Hi analysts!

I’ve got a final interview coming up for a role as a junior analyst and I’m a bit unsure how to prepare. 

I’ve already had an interview with HR, a technical test, a case study interview with two senior analysts and now I have a final interview with the MD/CMO of my country’s head office. 

I knew exactly how to prepare for the HR and case study interview. But I’m at a loss as to what this final interview is “testing for”.  The fact I’ve passed means they think I am a good fit and I have the analytic potential for the job. 

Do you think this interview is just be a final seal of approval and as long as I’m a normal person I’ll be alright?

Should I read up more on high level strategy and more external factors like competitors etc as potential topics to discuss?

I am also just planning on asking questions like what the MDs personal journey to this company was, what they like most about working at this company, if they can share any of the company’s next short term goals etc. 

Any other tips/things to prepare for are welcome! (I really really want this position)

Issue with adding sums from Google Sheets in Data Studio—there's no way it's actually this hard!,Discussion,"I'm trying to combine data from Google Sheets to count new website leads over time, and for some reason it's like the hardest thing I've ever had to figure out. Surely I'm overthinking this somehow??

[https://imgur.com/mehchqa](https://imgur.com/mehchqa)

Check the image to see what I'm trying to do. This is a sheet primarily used by our Sales dept. to track leads. What I need to do is count the total sum of each column, group those 10 sums into 5 larger categories, and display that info in a pie chart (I'm sure there will be other applications but let's start there).

One caveat: I really cannot change the layout of this document. I might be able to eventually, but for now I really want to avoid requesting that.

Doing a simple Scorecard on one of these columns gives me the total just fine, but when I make a simple function to combine (\[PRODUCT A\] + \[PRODUCT B\]) it returns No data. What gives?

I thought I was onto the solution when I used a custom CASE field function to separate the data into my 5 big categories and viewed record count for each one, but the big problem there is the fact that the occasional .5's and 2's in the columns are counted as 1. And trying to make a field function which searches only for .5's doesn't really work because the .5's in the original sheet are always on the same row as another .5, so it's counted as a different record.

IDK how good of a job I'm doing describing this, but I think the desired goal is quite simple: I just need to be able to have a running total of leads in these 5 big categories using the Google Sheet I was provided, without making changes to said Sheet.

Adobe Analytics' Missing Data,Discussion,"In the last year, about 2% of our orders were found in our BI data but not in our Adobe Analytics' data.  That's over 13,000 orders (about 36 per day) and $1.7 million in missing revenue in Adobe.  On any particular day, it's not very noticeable, but over time it adds up.

I'm scratching my head because every order placed hits our site and should be recorded by Adobe.  Help me if I'm thinking about this wrongly, but the question in my mind is what would possibly prevent Adobe from capturing orders?  I have at least a dozen solid ideas.  They center around the pixel not firing (either failing to fire or being blocked somehow), or something on Adobe's end (order dedupe although I can't believe Adobe has seen this sequence of order numbers before, or it could be that these orders are triggering signals of suspected bot traffic).

If any of you have ideas or some experience with this issue, I'm very curious.

What’s up with Google Analytics and PDFs?,Google Analytics,"I’m wondering if anyone has insight on tracking PDF views in GA. Hear me out first, it’s technical. 

I have a website with many PDFs linked on different pages. So far so good. 

I have a bunch of 301 redirects going from old addresses to new ones, as a redesign changed the name of many of the PDFs. Okay, that’s working fine. 

I set up Tag Manager as usual and it’s running Analytics for me. Awesome. 

I thought that GA does not track PDF views, so I was going to set up an event tag to track downloads. 

However... there ARE some PDFs showing up in Analytics as page views. It doesn’t seem to be ALL of them though. The redirects alone vastly outnumber the stats that are popping up. 

I can’t tell why or how they’re getting tracked. I don’t have any events built in that would track them. 

I’m hoping to get stats for direct visits, as many of the PDFs show up in search, and I have all those redirects. I think a click triggered event will miss those. And why are a few of them showing up already?

Thanks to stumblybumble for getting me on the right track!

\-----

Hey all, I've been working on this all afternoon and I'm about at my wit's end! Hoping someone more experienced than me can help...

I'm building a Data Studio report for my company, and one of the things requested was a view into organic traffic split up into various content groupings on our site. For example, let's say we sell products related to red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. They want to know how often people enter the site because they clicked a page about blue, a page about red, etc etc, and they want to be able to see that graphed out over a dynamic time period.

I've created a field function that separates all of our pages into categories based on keywords found within the url, and I've managed to use this to display useful info via a table, a pie chart, and a pivot table. But now, I'm trying to graph Entrances for each of the topics over time in a line graph, and I just cannot figure out how to make it work.

The closest I've gotten is by using the aforementioned Pivot Table, which is successfully displaying my 6 categories (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and other) in the Y axis, individual dates in the X column at the top of the table, and corresponding Landing Page data in the table itself (not quite the same as entrances, but if I try to use entrances it breaks the table. Just another thing to try to sort out later I guess). This displays dynamic data just fine, but I can't figure out a way to graph the numbers I'm seeing!

It feels like the real problem here is that I need to use three distinct points of data: the new field function that separates pages into keyword categories, dates, and entrances. Only a pivot table will show me all three as far as I can tell.

I'm like THIS close to just exporting this pivot table as a CSV, c/ping that into a Google Sheet, making that a new data source, and using it to build a line graph that way, but that seems absolutely absurd, not to mention I'd have to manually update the data. Please help me solve this before I go and do something crazy like that!!

As per [https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/enhanced-ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/enhanced-ecommerce) we have the ability to set a **productView** and **productClick** dataLayer / events.

Running experiments where you make your product worse – the most underrated product manager tool,Discussion,"Let's imagine that a company’s management wants to allocate significant resources to the development of infrastructure that would increase their app’s speed. The hypothesis is that increasing the speed of the app will have a positive effect on the user experience and the key metrics.

Think of an experiment (an A/B test) to validate this hypothesis.

# Experiments where you make your product worse

The above-mentioned example is one of the challenges that my students face. Almost 70% of the students suggest speeding up the app and then measuring the effect using an A/B test.

Here’s why this approach is problematic: Optimizing the app’s speed is a costly process. And the goal of the experiment is to decide whether the effect of increasing the speed of the app is worth making the investment in designing and implementing the right components and modifications. But if you have to implement the speed upgrade just to conduct the experiment (and pay the costs), then what’s the point of the experiment in the first place?

A quick and inexpensive alternative to test this hypothesis is to use an experiment where you make your product worse. We will slow down the test version of the product (which is usually much simpler than implementing the speed optimization) and check whether doing so will have a negative impact on the key product metrics. If the impact is negative, then we can say that the speed of the app affects the key metrics and implement the speed upgrade. Thus, we should allocate resources to accelerate the product. If there is no measurable impact, then we can leave things as they are and avoid the costs of making a modification that will not have a substantial return on investment.

In reality, things are a bit more complicated. The dependency is not always linear. For example, the speed of a product may already be so low that its deterioration won’t affect the metrics in any way. The approach, however, stays the same. It simply shows the range of its applicability. We must consider such things when designing and interpreting the results of these experiments.

There’s a real-world example for this approach. The Financial Times conducted this experiment once. You can read about it here. From my personal experience I can say that this approach is widely used at Facebook and other big tech companies.

Only 30% of students suggested slowing down the app (it is worth noting that they weren’t given a hint within the article’s title). In real life, the percent of people who would dare make such as suggestion is much smaller. The percent of people who would actually do it would probably be close to zero.

In companies with a poor culture of experimenting and working with data, the idea of making the product worse will most likely meet resistance. Notably, even in companies where the data has already become an important part of the product development cycle, offering to conduct this type of experiment may well bewilder the product team members.

# Three stages of A/B testing evolution in companies

For most companies, A/B testing is a theoretical concept that has nothing to do with real work. Some companies use experiments to study the effect of new features and product changes on key metrics. However, only a few of them use experiments to determine what direction the product’s development should take.

Experiments make it possible to understand which levers influence the product and which don’t. They also measure how great the potential of each of the levers is. Without this information, prioritizing resources and projects looks more like making random guesses than a rational, calculated process.

Experiments where you make products worse is an effective tool to reduce uncertainty by first evaluating the potential impact of a particular product’s component on key metrics.

# Experiments where you make your product worse

Company X believes that push notifications is the driver for its app’s retention rate. For most companies, this simple assumption may be enough to assemble a dedicated team that will be in charge of push notifications. But the management of Company X wants to make sure that this is the best possible use of its resources. So it decides to experiment by disabling push notifications for some users. Once done, they will measure the impact of push notifications on the key product metrics.

The results of this experiment provide the foundation for making the right decision. The experiment will demonstrate the impact push notifications have on the app’s key metrics. Now that it has reliable information on whether a dedicated team could increase the effect, the company’s management can decide whether the investment is worth it.

This approach is applicable to a lot of hypotheses, which, at first glance, may seem like obvious ways to improve user metrics and experience, but in reality fail to do so.

*Suggestion:* Adding more levels will improve the game, because levels are the core concept of the game and holds everything else together.  
*How to verify:* Remove some of the available game levels for half of new users and examine the effect on the key metrics.

*Suggestion:* If the users don’t get a quick response from the support team, then we risk losing them. Therefore, we need to reduce the response time, and to do this we may …  
*How to verify:* We must form several customer cohorts who will receive replies from the support team at different speeds. Then we need to assess the effect of response time on key metrics.

*Suggestion:* We receive a lot of complaints regarding the quality of the search feature on our online store. We need to form a team that will be in charge of improving the search functionality.  
*How to verify:* First, we remove the search feature for some of the users and check whether the key metrics are affected. Then we will evaluate how much the team will be able to improve it, what benefits will it bring, how it relates to the overall cost of the project, and what other options are on the table.

Experiments are the only way to check whether an observed correlation between a product modification and key metric changes is causal or not. Such experiments help us test in a quick and affordable fashion how deteriorating a certain parameter affects key metrics. That is why they work so well when it comes to prioritizing projects.

# Cons of experiments where you make your product worse

Those who stand against this type of experiments say that deteriorating the product spoils user experience, increases churn rate, brings negative feedback and affects the brand reputation in a bad way.

Based on personal experience, I would say that this concern is greatly exaggerated. You will be surprised at how often degrading tests will have no significant effect on the product (and this is a very important piece of knowledge).

But even if there is a negative impact, then try looking at this issue from a different perspective. You have limited resources. One option is to distribute them between projects blindly (or almost blindly, that is, based on your current hypothesis about the product). In this case, you have an unknown chance of improving the user experience in the product. But you’ll have to spend several months to implement the new feature and evaluate its effect on the key metrics. If your experiment fails, you would have wasted precious resources and time that could have been spent on more impactful things.

Alternatively, you can conduct a series of quick degrading experiments, spoiling the experience of a small percentage of the product’s users for a short period. But as a result, you will cut down the time of reaching a conclusion and increase the chances of correctly distributing your resources. As a result, you will make the product better for all of its users, including those who will join in the future.

# Unintentional experiments where you make your product worse

If my arguments did not convince you to use this type of experiment intentionally, you can still benefit from it in other ways.

All companies run degrading experiments. Most of them are unintentional and happen when the team accidentally breaks something in the product.

The next time this happens in your company, do your best to make things right again, but also study the impact of the negative changes on the metrics. Thus observing the damage made can help you find a new lever of influence on the product.

The unintentional degrading experiment I made that influenced the product’s strategy

API.AI (now Dialogflow) is the company where I was developing the smart voice assistant Assistant.ai.

It was a very challenging task with no easy solutions at hand. Most services are built around solving one specific problem, and they do their best to solve it well. But in the case of our smart assistant, the expectations of users were so diverse that it was nearly impossible to choose the focus and design the perfect onboarding experience for new users.

Our initial strategy was to identify the most popular features and skills that users expected in an assistant. We would then place these features at the center of our product and build the onboarding flow around these skills (quite a challenging task for a product where the main interface is vocal, not visual). This approach led to a number of small victories. But due to natural limitations, such as the duration of the first session, the voice interface, and a huge variety of usage patterns, it led to a dead-end.

But then help came from an unexpected place when one day, our key product metrics fell by 20%.

It took us a whole week to investigate what was the matter. The fact that we had launched a new version of the product right before the drop only made things more complicated. As it turned out, the update had nothing to do with the drop in metrics. The reason was within the changes made in the third-party voice recognition service from Google, which we used on Android for some of the languages in our product.

Google had started to experiment with the way its voice recognition service detected the end of speech by examining pauses. The metrics dropped when Google decided to reduce the time it would wait for a person to continue talking. But in reality, while speaking, we often pause when we are thinking about what to say next. This is especially true for communication with virtual assistants when you ask it to do something (make a note or to add a reminder, etc). As a result, the users often didn’t have time to complete their sentence.

The decline in the quality of one of the fundamental technologies supporting the Assistant led to a greater change in metrics than any of the changes we had made earlier.

Our understanding of the product model and what was and wasn’t important changed dramatically after this unintentional degrading experiment. Before this incident, we had focused on what the Assistant could do and how it presented its skills to users. But then it became obvious that the quality of the key technologies that the product was built around (i.e., voice recognition and Natural Language Understanding \[NLU\]) is a much more powerful lever to improve the user experience and make the product better.

This kind of experience is crucial when discussing the prioritization of vital resources. This is the knowledge I obtained as a result of an unintentional experiment that made the product worse. Who knows what revelations your experiments will bring?

HR Meeting,Discussion,"I am the only data analyst at my firm, supporting all clients across the vertical. In the past year,  we’ve gained several new clients and we’re looking to onboard a couple more. Work load has increased, but is not super unmanageable.

It shows the active user (me) on the browser, desktop and on a mobile device. However, why does it not save the data for the audience reports once I am out of the Amor webpage (clients' site)? Do I need to give it over 24 hours for it to save all the data and then display the reports to me tomorrow?

I had difficulties from the start of this. After getting my Beginners Google Analytics Certificate, I've been trying to learn more in-depth by myself to get the gist of it. For example, Amor had a different tracking code. So, I updated all the PHP files with the tracking code I was given in my Admin, Tracking Info. I had a problem with Tag Manager but that was solved by blocking Adblocks on the site. Tag Manager shows no more errors but two results of tag analysis - Global Site Tag and Google Analytics.

"Analytics from ""processed"" sales data excel sheet",Discussion,"Hi there, I'm kinda new to the analytics scene so I would greatly appreciate some advice. My finance department releases a BIG excel sheet spanning 4 years of sales data for our products with the raw data and various other tabs containing pivot tables.

In the youngest on my PM team and our ""business development"" person is stuck in the early 2000's. I feel like I can get info faster and pilot a new way of processing sales data.

I would also like to automatically update my database monthly with the new info. Can this be done without any additional coding?

Starting my career this year - looking for advice from my experienced peoples,Discussion,"I am a double major in Economics and Analytics. I'm very good at framing business problems for data solutions (understanding what type data would be useful, how it could be gathered, where it could be found, etc), but I don't necessarily enjoy being the one to pull the data and perform the analysis of it. I have knowledge of Python and R, but I prefer SQL and building dashboards (e.g. Microsoft Power BI) to query and visualize data and derive insights that way. I have been job searching by looking for simply ""entry level analyst"", but of course that is a mixed bag of roles and many of them are geared more towards statistical analysis type of work.

So my question is: based on my skill set I outlined above, is there a different title or type of job I should be looking for that would match my preferences better?

"Big discrepancy between GA and advertising platform (FB, TW, YT, LI)",Google Analytics,"Hi guys

Currently, we're facing a big discrepancy between the metrics for link clicks we see on various platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn) and the number of sessions we're tracking in Google Analytics.

We're aware that typically GA shows fewer sessions, e.g. because people jump off before the page loads, don't accept the tracking of cookies, etc. However, the discrepancy is so big (*4 or 5 times*) that we feel this doesn't explain it. On Twitter, for example, the difference is around 1'400 link clicks vs. 250 sessions in GA.

There is also an indicator that the problem is bigger on sessions recorded for mobile than for such tracked on desktop devices.

Would anybody have an idea of how we could find out what the problem is or knows a good article that helps with troubleshooting? I've seen this official article but don't see any of these points being the reason: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1257084?hl=en).
